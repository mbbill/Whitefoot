# Spec & test approvals ledger

Current note (2026-07-22): the hash-baseline protocol described next is
historical. It operated from 2026-07-18 until the research-compiler governance
simplification. The scope amendment and later exact-boundary approvals are at
the end of this file.

Append-only. The kernel specification and the semantics-bearing test surface are
OWNER-GATED. This file is the authorization record: an agent must obtain the
owner's explicit approval for a change to a guarded surface, append an entry
here, and only then commit. Approval of a plan or phase is **not** approval to
change the spec.

Guarded surfaces (see `tools/spec_guard.py`):

- numbered kernel specs `spec/kernel-spec-v*.md` — any add/remove/in-place edit;
- conformance expected verdicts `conformance/manifest.jsonl` + `conformance/cases/**`;
- frozen oracle digests in `tools/codegen_parity.py`, `tools/test_checked_automation.py`;
- reference semantics tests `prototype/checker/test_checker.py`, `prototype/democ/test_codegen.py`.

Adding a new test or a new conformance case is always allowed. Modifying,
deleting, or weakening an existing one — or regenerating a pinned oracle digest —
requires an approval below. Never make a failing check pass by changing what it
expects.

An approval that relaxes a rule or changes accepted semantics must rest on a
recorded investigation — the alternatives considered, pros and cons, a soundness
argument, and data — and must cite where that investigation is recorded (the
decision-gates.md line or dossier path). Every approval's stated reason must rest
on evidence, never on convenience or on the shape of existing code.

Protocol for an approved change:

1. Present the exact delta to the owner and get explicit approval in the session.
2. Make the change (numbered specs bump version + rename; never edit in place).
3. Run `make approve-spec REASON="<what the owner approved>"`. This regenerates
   `governance/guard-baseline.json` and appends an entry with its `baseline`
   hash. `make check`'s `spec-guard` layer fails on any guarded change whose
   baseline hash is not logged here.

Each entry records: the date, that the owner approved, the reason, the
`baseline` SHA-256 the approval authorizes, and, for a rule relaxation or
semantic change, a pointer to the recorded investigation it rests on.

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Governance baseline: establish the spec/test guard at the committed main state (commit c18013b); no guarded content changed. Owner-directed governance lockdown 2026-07-18.
- baseline: 0e876fd68b1da613de96364ba1d5ce33ccebe7c3ea508b0ad0d2dc06f9709749

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved bounded-reborrow relaxation v0.6->v0.7 (statement-scoped child reborrow; OWN-5/6/9/12 + new STOR-5; PATTERNS P4). Approved in session 2026-07-18 after the recorded investigation at optimizer-language-research/implementation/reborrow-investigation/ (DOSSIER; model-check RESULTS 1M programs/0 violations; FR reconciliation; fact-channel review PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS; PACKET; V0.7-DELTA-DRAFT). Guarded changes: new spec kernel-spec-v0.7.md; three conformance META annotations re-versioned to v0.7. No test or oracle weakened.
- baseline: 48cc850aabdbd730792f2f973d85f13896cbea01e3eb2f387963e9f3d29b1db6

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved region-retention checkpoint (THE-PLAN Phase-2 next step, salvaged from parked_edits, 2026-07-18): fix conformance case x-typ-value-where-borrow-param.wf malformed region param [r]->['r] + explicit region arg (same TYPE-5 reject verdict; required now that stage-0 democ correctly enforces FORM-3 region spelling). Also pins the additive test_codegen.py region-arg tests. No expected verdict weakened; the case still rejects at TYPE-5.

## 2026-07-19 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved v0.7->v0.8 tag-only enum equality: exact eeq/ene delta and guarded conformance-META updates in enum-equality-investigation/V0.8-DELTA-DRAFT.md
- baseline: 3222e16164d319ba4367368aeabe7396d4360d144e07fd68e819b3afc2f54630

## 2026-07-20 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved retirement of prototype/democ/test_codegen.py with the archived democ implementation on 2026-07-20; test bytes preserved under archive/toolchains/self-hosting-2026-07-20/democ/test_codegen.py; kernel v0.8, conformance cases and verdicts, frozen oracle digests, and active prototype/checker/test_checker.py unchanged.

No expected-verdict, runnable-status, frozen-oracle, or existing reference-test change. Investigation: grammar-verifier/proposal/DELTA.md and SUCCESSOR-HOSTILE-REVIEW.md.

## 2026-07-22 — ledger scope amendment

The hash-baseline guard described above was retired on 2026-07-22. Its entries
remain unchanged as the exact audit record for the period in which it operated.
Later approvals record the approved artifact or change boundary directly and do
not invent a retired baseline hash.

Owner rulings before this separate ledger began on 2026-07-18 are preserved in
`governance/directives.md` and in the versioned records indexed by
`governance/decision-log.md`. They are not duplicated here because many of them
authorized research or selected a direction without approving a protected
specification or test change.

## 2026-07-21 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Approve the exact Phase-5 successor proposal SHA-256 `7fc48cc30f94d25be5be1106e3265d92c1b0cdf2bfea5a7a17759a12f3cf092d` and generated v0.10 candidate SHA-256 `71073e25219455896250e15e13d1ffdbfc443c87a9b28cb9906d73a020dc33e9`. The approval selected the reviewed language delta and architecture consequences but did not itself install v0.10 or authorize resolver implementation.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.9.md` (`PHASE5-SUCCESSOR-OWNER-APPROVAL`)

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Correct the protected `fn7-neg-two-mains` evidence to v0.10 TYPE-6 duplicate-declaration behavior and authorize preparation, hostile review, and owner presentation of the bounded v0.11 semantic-closure candidate. This did not approve candidate activation before exact-byte review.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.10.md` (`V010-DUPLICATE-MAIN-CORRECTION-AND-V011-SEMANTIC-CLOSURE-AUTHORIZATION`)

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Select `propagate` as the sole ERR-3 Result-forwarding spelling, with no `try` compatibility alias, and approve exact v0.11 candidate SHA-256 `050e110c8c5eb3143c9d3f54968a9df9125f1d4b5991f527b8a15938a4292fbc` for append-only activation with synchronized compiler, conformance, and reference-model updates.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.11.md` (`V011-PROPAGATE-SPELLING-CANDIDATE-FREEZE` and `V011-OWNER-APPROVED-ACTIVATION`)
