Node: language/surface-form

Decision: Each semantic construct has exactly one spelling and one byte-level formatting, non-canonical input is rejected rather than reformatted, and whether an element is written is decided by its grammar class alone, because a rule keyed on whether the checker could infer an element at a site would force the writer to simulate the checker to know what is even writable and would grow the specification by one clause per relieved position, instead of per-position relief.

Decision: There are no comments; documentation lives in a declaration's doc field, because a comment is text the checker cannot see and a doc field is a checked part of the declaration, instead of free-form comments.

Decision: Computation is flat three-address form, one operation per expression with every intermediate named by a binding, because the form is performance-neutral by measurement and it removes precedence, nesting, and lookahead from the language, instead of nested expressions with precedence.

Decision: A body binder's mode and type are derived from its self-typed right-hand side and never written, without reading a later statement or use site, because those annotations duplicate information available at the declaration, while callable parameter and result types remain explicit at their trust boundary, instead of annotating body binders.

Decision: Callable boundaries write value parameters as `name: T`, references as `name: &T` or `name: &[T]`, and results as explicit owned types, because [the boundary comparison](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/blob/3b2d1b6f41aeecd70d664b63e57f4cc235f7cdaf/research/investigations/contract-surface/CALL-BOUNDARY.md#candidate-parameter-and-result-modes) shows that the reference marker determines parameter kind and references cannot be results, instead of retaining an `own` keyword with no further boundary distinction.

Decision: Iteration has two source forms, an ordinary loop with an optional label and break, and an ascending unit-stride half-open counted loop over once-captured endpoints whose binder is compiler-updated and source-immutable, because the sole-form commitment made every bounded walk spell its own counter, guard, and increment, whose carried facts the loop head then discarded, and three real SHA-256 index walks plus three of four hostile writer probes independently selected the same ascending half-open counted shape, instead of loop-plus-break as the only iteration form.

Decision: Every numeric literal carries an explicit type suffix, the generic identities 0_T and 1_T under a numeric bound being the only relief, because the language is as explicit as it can be by design, instead of literal types inferred from context.

Rejected:
- Per-position relief, where an element is forbidden wherever the checker can reconstruct it and mandatory elsewhere: rejected because legality must be decidable from the grammar class alone, and a rule keyed on inference success at a site makes the writer simulate the checker and grows the specification by one conditional clause per position.
