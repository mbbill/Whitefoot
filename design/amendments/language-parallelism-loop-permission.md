Node: language/parallelism/loop-permission

Decision: A counted loop admits at most one accumulator from a fixed associative set and enclosing writes through one proved constant-coefficient affine element map per resolved root or disjoint subranges of an adjacent stride partition with invariant runtime stride and base, consuming retained source proofs, because reductions and [range helpers](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/blob/b3341e32ab8d69e2974227aee7146ac16eb2fe00/research/investigations/range-loans/DESIGN.md#counted-loop-permission) expose useful independence without depending on worker count, instead of arbitrary scatter, unbounded multi-accumulator reductions or restricting writes to element maps. Whole-source access to mapped or assigned storage and incompatible maps on overlapping storage deny permission.

Decision: An iteration passes its storage partition as an ordinary range-reference argument and uses the shared path-overlap judgment for cross-iteration separation, because the same half-open range proof can serve calls, adjacent statements and iterations, instead of a loop-specific exclusive view and loan mechanism.

Rejected:
- Exclusive view descriptors for iteration partitions: rejected because ordinary range references carry the same partition and use the common separation judgment without another permission or lifetime mechanism.
