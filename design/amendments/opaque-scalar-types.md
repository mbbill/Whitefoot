Node: language/system-interface/opaque-scalar-types

Decision: A value such as ExitStatus or SocketAddress has a type its standard library module declares as an opaque struct and is built by an ordinary total construction function, the constructor call on the type itself being refused as it is on every other opaque struct (`language/data-model/opaque-struct`), because exact nominal typing prevents an arbitrary integer from serving as that value while a construction function makes every intended value expressible, instead of a bare integer alias or a constructor privilege tied to native implementation.

Rejected:
- Replaced clause, that the prelude declares the type: rejected because the owner's ruling that moved the host declarations into the standard library declares `ExitStatus` in `std::process` and `SocketAddress` in `std::net` (`language/system-interface/declaration-home`), which this node had not followed.
