Node: language/contracts

Decision: A container receives hash, equality, and comparison as explicit function-kind arguments, with formal and actual groups abbreviating their signatures and arguments hygienically, because the owning-map and priority-queue witnesses need reusable behavior without runtime representation or dispatch cost, instead of function values, dictionaries, implicit type-owned implementations, or repeating every member signature at every library layer.

Decision: A formal member's declared effect row and written contract are the authoritative callable boundary, and a supplied actual may refine that boundary, its row a subset of the formal's, its `requires` weaker, its `ensures` stronger, while its parameter and result modes and types agree exactly, because a generic caller must retain one written boundary it can read without knowing which implementation was selected, while an implementation that touches less state or demands less of its caller can always stand in for one that demands more, instead of requiring the actual's contract to be structurally equal to the formal's, or deriving the caller's boundary from the selected body.

Decision: Member calls use the instantiated formal signature, row and contracts while the selected actual is checked independently, because a container's written boundary must not vary with which implementation is selected, instead of importing an actual body's smaller row or stronger inferred facts into its callers.

Decision: Supplied behavior carries no assumed equality, comparison, or hashing laws, because hostile behavior must still preserve ownership and proved bounds even when the container holds unexpected contents, instead of using an unchecked law as a safety premise or retaining source law declarations without a selected consumer.

Decision: A formal member's reference parameters carry no region, loan, or store vocabulary, and a member call relates the caller's storage to the callee only through the member's effect row substituted with the argument paths at that call, because a reference is a local name for a path with no identity of its own and there is one heap, so there is nothing left for a member signature to quantify or for an actual to capture, instead of per-member quantified loan regions, a group-wide loan region, or store brands captured in an actual's type arguments.

Rejected:
- Runtime dictionaries or callable values for container behavior: rejected because the selected map and queue need direct-call specialization without runtime storage or dispatch.
- Checking actual rows for equality with the formal row: rejected because an actual that accesses only a declared subfield fits the caller's contract without dummy reads or a runtime adapter.
- An owned function-formal result required to be fresh: rejected because it depended on the removed history of owned values and excluded ordinary ownership-returning functions from the common callable boundary.
- An implication solver or search deciding that an actual's `requires` is weaker and its `ensures` stronger: rejected because automatic derivation is specification-fixed, deterministic and terminating, so a refinement admitted at a binding must be decided by a fixed finite check, not by a search whose success selects acceptance.
