//! Every diagnostic sentence this work added, pinned by a probe that compiles
//! a source program and compares the exact rendered text.
//!
//! A diagnostic sentence is the product: it is what a writer reads and acts
//! on. A sentence no test compares is free to drift, and the gate verification
//! of 2026-08-28 found fifty-four of them in exactly that state — landed,
//! rendered, and not pinned by a test. This module is the one home for the corpus that
//! closes that: one minimal source per form, the rule it must cite, and the
//! exact fragments its rendered rejection must contain. Adding a sentence to
//! the compiler means adding a row here.
//!
//! The rows are deliberately redundant with the per-item tests in
//! `driver::tests` and in `semantic::tests`: those pin one sentence beside the
//! program that motivated it and explain why the sentence says what it says,
//! and this table proves no sentence is missing from that set. A sentence
//! removed from the compiler fails here; a sentence reworded fails here.
//!
//! The sentences listed below are not rows, because no source program reaches
//! them. Each is a defensive arm behind an earlier rejection or behind a
//! spelling v0.60 removed, and the reason is checkable one by one. The list is
//! kept complete rather than counted: a count is a second record of the same
//! thing and drifts, and this one already had.
//!
//! - `parameter #{ordinal}` in `entailment::flow::render_goal_datum`, and the
//!   `[parameter #{ordinal}]` subscript step beside it, name a formal, and
//!   only *concrete* goals are rendered.
//! - `no operand in position {index} for this row` in
//!   `check::expressions::calls` needs more operands than the selected row
//!   takes; [OP-1] rejects the arity first.
//! - [EFF-1]'s non-parameter-root reason and its repair need an effect root
//!   that resolves to a value and is not a parameter; the resolver rejects
//!   every such root as an unresolved `EffectRoot` use first.
//! - The two subscript-operand sentences of `check::expressions::flat_storage`
//!   -- "a written move, which consumes rather than indexes" and "an atom that
//!   is not a place", both under the expectation "a place, which a subscript
//!   indexes" -- were reached in v0.59 through the measure-former call
//!   `len_of(...)`, whose operand was an ordinary atom. v0.60 reads a measure
//!   as the `psuffix` `P.len` [OP-15, MSR-1], and [GRAM-5] writes a subscript
//!   only below a `place`, so no source presents either operand shape.
//! - "an array, buffer, or slice place", the same module's scalar-base
//!   sentence, retires with the same former for the same reason: a measure
//!   member read on an unmeasured place is [MSR-1]'s own [TYPE-5] rejection
//!   carrying the measured types, not this one.
//!
//! Two bullets this list used to carry are gone with their sentences rather
//! than with their reachability: `check::expressions::region_spelling` and
//! `slice_of`'s "a borrow of a runtime value binding or a named const" pair no
//! longer exist anywhere in the compiler, regions and view formers having left
//! the language [REF-1, REF-4].
//!
//! C2 deletes the PAR-3 staging report and its three exclusive sentences.
//! Ordinary call diagnostics remain pinned below.
