//! The permission judgment P over adjacent statements of one block [PAR-1].
//!
//! Each grant fixture is a shape a real program writes; each denial fixture
//! violates exactly one numbered condition and asserts *that* condition, so a
//! denial arriving for the wrong reason fails the test. Design:
//! `research/investigations/proof-derived-parallelism/DESIGN.md` section 3.
//!
//! v0.60 judges two *adjacent* statements. There is no interposed window and
//! no `PairSide::Between`: a statement written between two calls is judged
//! against each of its two neighbours on its own, and what lets all three
//! overlap together is the run. The fixtures that used to put a statement
//! between two calls therefore assert the adjacency that carries the hazard,
//! or the run the three statements form. Loans, arenas, and the
//! exclusive/shared distinction are gone with [CAP-1], so every interference
//! denial is one `Denial::Footprint` over `own`, `&`, path overlap and the
//! effect row; dataflow is a footprint conflict too, because "a `let`'s
//! defined binding is a write path".
//!
//! Because every adjacency of a block is judged, a fixture's trailing
//! `return` forms a pair of its own with the last call it follows. The
//! helpers below therefore name the two members of the adjacency under test
//! rather than assuming a function has exactly one pair.
