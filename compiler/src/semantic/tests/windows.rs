//! [WIN-1] through [WIN-3], [TYPE-9], [TYPE-10] and the window, construction
//! and release operations [OP-10, OP-13, OP-14, OP-15].
//!
//! This module replaces `tests/buffers.rs` (22 tests), whose subject was
//! v0.59's `buffer` storage class and the store apparatus around it. Each
//! retirement has a named successor:
//!
//! - The storage names `buffer`, `FixedVector`, `Vector<'s, T>`, `arena<'r, T>`
//!   and `box<T>` retire with [TYPE-2]'s and [GRAM-3]'s alternatives. The
//!   successor is [TYPE-9]: `Array`, `Slots` and `Ring` in a constant-capacity
//!   and a runtime-capacity form each, and the cell `Box<T>` whose content is
//!   its field `inner`.
//! - [BLK-1]'s two-run inventory, [BLK-2]'s formation rows, [BLK-3]'s refusal
//!   of swap, growth and middle removal, [BLK-4]'s confinement and [PROV-1]'s
//!   store/provider/capability table retire. The successor is the ordinary
//!   [PRE-1] records: the nine window operations [OP-10], the nine
//!   construction functions [OP-13], `swap` [OP-11] and `free_empty` [OP-14],
//!   over one heap [STOR-8].
//! - `buffer_new`, `buffer_vacant`, `array_new` and `box_new`'s old spelling
//!   leave [OP-1]'s table; `buffer_fits` and its static allocation-fit
//!   predicate leave with them. The successor of the fit predicate is [OP-9]'s
//!   allocation-size obligation, still an `AllocationFit` obligation family in
//!   the checker but now stated over `stride_ceiling(T) * n` staying inside
//!   u64, carried by each runtime-capacity construction and by `grow`.
//! - `dispose` retires with the capability leaves. The successor is [OP-14]
//!   `free_empty(window: move r)` on a proved-empty window, and for an affine
//!   value, moving it into a function that consumes it [PROV-6].
//! - The `len_of` / `cap_of` / `vacant_of` / `extent_of` former family retires.
//!   The successor is [OP-15]: `r.len`, `r.cap` and `r.head` are place forms,
//!   not calls.
//!
//! The sources are the already-ported v0.60 conformance cases; these tests add
//! the rule and issue kind the corpus manifest does not pin.
//!
//! Two of the judgments below are stated by the specification and are NOT
//! implemented by the checker as this package lands. Each assertion here is
//! the normative verdict, not the current one, because an unimplemented
//! feature is not a source-language rejection and must not rewrite a
//! normative expectation. The two gaps, with the code that owns each:
//!
//! 1. [OP-10]'s compiler-owned window type parameter is not inferred from the
//!    operand. `check/generics.rs` (`generic_substitution`) refuses any call
//!    to a callee with type parameters and no written argument list, citing
//!    FN-2, while [OP-10] states that "a window operation, `swap` [OP-11],
//!    and `free_empty` [OP-14] therefore write no type arguments at a call:
//!    every type parameter of those rows is supplied by an operand".
//! 2. A runtime-capacity `Slots<T>` or `Ring<T>`, and a constant-capacity
//!    `Ring<T, N>`, stop as an unimplemented compiler capability at
//!    `check/types.rs`.
//!
//! The judgments this package's port closed, and which are now ordinary
//! assertions above: a `Box`'s content reached by the bare field step
//! `b.inner` and consumed by `let n = move b.inner;` [TYPE-9, WIN-3]; a move
//! out of a window slot citing WIN-3 with `MoveOutOfSlot`; [OP-14]'s own site
//! for an undischarged `free_empty` requirement; [OP-9]'s allocation-size
//! obligation at each runtime-capacity construction and at `grow`, rendered
//! as its defining comparison rather than as the retired `buffer_fits` row;
//! and [OP-15]'s measure member read in expression position, including one
//! over a subscripted place.
