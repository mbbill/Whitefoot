//! [WIN-3] owned places: there is no take operation and no hole.
//!
//! The v0.59 subject of this module was the `box` referent read-out, the
//! multi-target commit `set (a, b) = ...;`, and holder suspension. All three
//! are retired in v0.60, and so are the `replace` statement and the inline
//! view the module's remaining cases rested on. Each retirement has a named
//! successor:
//!
//! - [LIV-2]'s `box` referent read-out retires. The successor is [WIN-3] with
//!   [TYPE-9]: a `Box`'s content is its field `inner`, `let n = move b.inner;`
//!   consumes the whole cell rather than reading one referent out of a live
//!   owner, the owner's other affine parts take their compiler-derived release
//!   [STOR-3], and a remaining linear part is the partial-consume refusal
//!   exercised in `a_partial_consume_that_abandons_a_linear_part_is_refused`
//!   below.
//! - [LIV-2]'s multi-target commit retires with [GRAM-4]'s `set_stmt`, which
//!   writes exactly one place. The successor spelling is one `set` per place,
//!   and `swap(first: &a, second: &b)` [OP-11] for a two-place exchange.
//! - [OWN-5]'s loan-conflict matrix and holder suspension retire with the
//!   loans. The successor is [REF-2] reference validity together with
//!   [EFF-5]'s clause 3, whose coverage is `tests/references.rs`.
//! - [SET-2]'s `replace` statement and its affine element exchange retire. The
//!   successor is [WIN-3]'s commit disposition: assigning over an owned place
//!   releases an affine old value and is a hard error when the old value is
//!   linear, exercised in `assigning_over_a_linear_owned_place_is_refused`
//!   below.
//! - [VIEW-2] retires with the views; the successor is [REF-4]'s range
//!   reference `&v[lo..hi]`, whose coverage is `tests/references.rs`.
//! - [STOR-4] retires with regions and arenas; there is no successor and no
//!   replacement spelling.
//! - The `BoxReferentMove` and `BorrowedBufferDescriptorMutation` capability
//!   stops retire with their subjects: an affine referent moved out of a live
//!   owning indirection, and rebinding a borrowed buffer descriptor, are both
//!   v0.59 mechanisms v0.60 does not have.
//!
//! What survives is the part of this module that was never about the read-out:
//! [OWN-1]'s whole-binding kill, which no index separation keeps alive, and
//! the terminal type a field step selects from an element. Both are retargeted
//! below onto the already-ported v0.60 conformance cases and v0.60 spellings.

// One-line record of each retired test of this module, naming the rule it
// exercised and that rule's successor:
//
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `box_referent_read_out_spends_the_selected_storage_once` had the referent read-out and the multi-target commit as its whole subject; the successor is [WIN-3]'s whole-owner consume `let n = move b.inner;` and [GRAM-4]'s one place per `set_stmt`.
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `box_referent_target_does_not_turn_an_owner_move_into_a_read_out` distinguished a read-out from an owner move; v0.60 has no read-out to distinguish, the successor being [WIN-3]'s single consume rule.
// Retired with [OWN-5]: `box_referent_read_out_preserves_shared_and_non_target_boundaries` asserted the loan-conflict matrix and the `BoxReferentMove` capability stop; the successor is [REF-2] validity plus [EFF-5] clause 3.
// Retired with [OWN-5]: `box_referent_read_out_preserves_holder_suspension` had holder suspension as its subject; the successor is [REF-2] validity plus [EFF-5] clause 3.
// Retired with [OWN-5]: `box_referent_descendant_extraction_keeps_its_cleanup_capability_boundary` asserted the `BoxReferentMove` capability stop over a descendant read-out; the successor is [WIN-3]'s whole-owner consume with [PROV-6]'s partial-consume refusal.
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `box_referent_read_out_rejects_a_later_reborrow_at_its_use` asserted a reborrow at a spent read-out target; the successor is [REF-2]'s use of an invalidated reference.
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `direct_field_index_reads_and_scalar_commits_use_the_terminal_type` paired the multi-target commit with an [OP-4] bound; the successor is [GRAM-4]'s one place per `set_stmt`, and [OP-4]'s subscript obligation keeps its own coverage in `tests/arrays.rs`.
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `proved_dynamic_indices_separate_one_commit_targets` separated two targets of one commit; the successor is [GRAM-4]'s one place per `set_stmt` and `swap` [OP-11] for a two-place exchange, with [OWN-7]'s index-step separation now answered at a call by [EFF-5].
// Retired with [OWN-5]: `a_rhs_cannot_mutate_an_index_captured_by_dynamic_commit_targets` asserted a loan conflict between a commit's captured indices and its right-hand side; the successor is [SET-1]'s target evaluation before the right-hand side, with [REF-2] deciding the reference half.
// Retired with [LIV-2]: `repeated_affine_element_read_out_keeps_type2_diagnostic_priority` ordered two diagnostics of one multi-target commit; the successor is [WIN-3], which owns the element move-out on its own.
// Retired with [SET-2]: `affine_nested_fields_are_exchanged_or_read_out_once` had `replace` and the multi-target commit as its subject; the successor is [WIN-3]'s commit disposition.
// Retired with [VIEW-2]: `exclusive_inline_view_retains_bounds_and_owner_loan` had the exclusive inline view and its owner loan as its subject; the successor is [REF-4]'s range reference with [REF-2] validity.
// Retired with [SET-2]: `borrowed_buffer_descriptor_replacement_is_an_explicit_capability_stop` asserted the `BorrowedBufferDescriptorMutation` stop over a `replace` through a borrow; the successor is [WIN-3]'s commit disposition, there being no borrowed descriptor to rebind.
// Retired with [SET-2]: `borrowed_aggregate_buffer_replacement_cannot_bypass_the_capability_stop` asserted the same stop through an aggregate; the successor is the same [WIN-3] commit disposition.
