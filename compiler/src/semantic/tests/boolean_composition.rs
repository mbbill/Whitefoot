//! O11 signed-Boolean-decomposition tests, in both directions.
//!
//! Direction one: ordinary establishment records and establishes exactly the
//! sound decomposition set — `+band` and `-bor` decompose into their signed
//! children recursively, `bnot` flips, and `-band`, `+bor`, and `bxor` on
//! either sign contribute nothing (the classic asymmetry: the other sign's
//! content is genuinely disjunctive).
//!
//! The obligations these guards protect now discharge, which is the rule's
//! purpose: the [ENT-3] members are facts at their establishment point.
//! Design: `research/investigations/o11-composition/DESIGN.md`.
