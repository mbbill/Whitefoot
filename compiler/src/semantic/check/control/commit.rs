//!
//! v0.59's multi-target commit is retired with [LIV-2]: the target list, the
//! ordinal types a call's result list supplied, the pairwise overlap
//! condition over two targets, the index-separation conflicts it deferred to
//! entailment, and the declaring `set` target that minted its own binding all
//! had more than one written place as their subject, and [GRAM-4] now writes
