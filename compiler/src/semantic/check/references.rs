//! [REF-1, REF-2, REF-3, REF-4] references: the checker side.
//!
//! A reference is a local name for a path [REF-1]. It is not storage of its
//! own, it carries no permission marker, no region and no loan, and it never
//! escapes the function that formed it [REF-3]. What the checker therefore
//! has to carry for a reference binding is exactly three things: the set of
//! paths it names, whether it is a `&T` or a `&[T]` [REF-4], and whether it
//! is still valid [REF-2].
//!
//! The validity fact is threaded through the statement walk rather than
//! recomputed on demand, because [REF-2]'s closing sentence puts it outside
//! the entailment fragment [ENT-1] and its invalidation set is exactly
//! enumerated: a proper prefix of the path is written, or the path or a
//! prefix is moved out of or released, by a statement, by a call [EFF-5], or
//! by a compiler-derived release at scope exit [STOR-3]; the scope of the
//! local variable the path starts at ends; or a window operation removes its
//! selected slot. An already selected payload survives its match's exit;
//! replacing its enum still invalidates it. Content writes preserve their
//! captured target, while unknown-depth covers conservatively invalidate
//! other potentially destroyed targets. Primitive leaf stores preserve
//! pointers, never the old contents' proof facts.
//!
//! Every path question — prefix, overlap, index and range separation — is
//! [OWN-7]'s, asked through [`super::super::places`] and answered nowhere
//! else.
