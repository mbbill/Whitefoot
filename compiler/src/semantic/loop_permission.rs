//! The counted permission judgment [PAR-2]: whether the iterations of one
//! counted `for` may be executed with overlapping execution, and whether the
//! one value they carry may be recombined across them.
//!
//! The adjacency judgment next door reads two *statements*, so two executions
//! of one statement are never a pair and a counted loop gets nothing however
//! independent its iterations are. This judgment reads the loop itself. It
//! refuses nothing, changes no acceptance, and grants no lowering by itself.
//!
//! # What is judged
//!
//! The unit is one `for_stmt` L with body B, and every written, read, and
//! operand-read footprint of a statement of B is formed exactly as [PAR-1]
//! forms one. Writing an *iteration-own* place for one rooted in a binding B
//! itself introduces, permission holds exactly when all four conditions hold:
//!
//! 1. **One accumulator, or none.** "Among whole-place writes of B, at most
//!    one place is rooted in a binding declared outside L; that binding is
//!    L's accumulator, and every occurrence of it in B is one operand of one
//!    `set` statement whose target is that whole binding and whose right-hand
//!    side is one operation applied to that operand and to a second operand
//!    reaching the accumulator nowhere." The operation is one of ten fixed
//!    for the accumulator across the whole of B.
//! 2. **Every written place is admitted.** "Every place a footprint of B
//!    writes is iteration-own storage, the accumulator's whole place, one
//!    proved single-binder affine element write, or one proved range
//!    reference." Nothing else is admitted, and no injectivity argument is
//!    searched for.
//! 3. **Resolved footprints.** "A footprint element whose caller place the
//!    implementation does not resolve overlaps every place, so an unresolved
//!    element denies permission rather than granting it."
//! 4. **No exit edge.** "Every normal continuation of every statement of B
//!    reaches L's compiler-owned binder update, so no statement of B is a
//!    `return_stmt`, a `give_stmt`, a `break_stmt` resolved to L or a loop
//!    enclosing L, or a `let_stmt` selecting `propagate_let_rhs`."
//!
//! # The two element families
//!
//! A **proved single-binder affine element write** is a `set_stmt` whose
//! target is one direct `Array` or `Slots` subscript rooted in an own binding
//! declared outside L, or reached through `deref` of a reference parameter
//! whose row declares the write, and whose discharged [OP-4] bounds
//! obligation retains the offset's exact value `a*i + b` for L's binder with
//! `a` nonzero. Distinct binder values therefore select distinct elements.
//! The `deref` needs no rule of its own here: it is an ordinary step of the
//! resolved path [REF-1, TYPE-7], so `deref(b)[a*i + c]` is recognized
//! exactly as an inline subscript is, which is what keeps every
//! runtime-capacity kernel in the family — [TYPE-9] admits a runtime-capacity
//! shape only as `Box` content [checker-facts].
//!
//! A `Ring` in an element-map position denies, "because a `Ring` subscript
//! selects the slot `(r.head + i) mod r.cap` [WIN-1], a wrapping map onto
//! storage rather than a linear offset".
//!
//! One affine map is admitted per resolved root. Every write to that root
//! must carry the same `a` and `b`, and every operand read through the same
//! root must be a direct subscript whose own discharged bounds result retains
//! the same `a` and `b`; a whole-root read, a different map, or an
//! unavailable one denies. That admits a same-index read-modify-write and
//! refuses a stencil, without any pairwise range search.
//!
//! A **proved range reference** is `&r[s*i+b..s*i+b+s]` [REF-4] passed as an
//! ordinary argument, whose discharged endpoint domain retains the exact
//! images `[s*i+b, s*i+b+s)` with `s` and `b` fixed throughout L and both
//! proved nonnegative. For distinct indices `i < j`, discreteness gives
//! `i+1 <= j` and nonnegative `s` gives `s*i+b+s <= s*j+b`, so the half-open
//! ranges do not overlap under [OWN-7]. Proved range references reached by
//! writes and whose origins overlap must name the same origin and carry
//! identical images. Every element access overlapping a written origin must
//! descend from a range with that partition. Read-only input origins may
//! overlap across iterations; they require no write partition.
//!
//! Forming a range reference reads its endpoints, reads no element content,
//! and authorizes no change to the origin's storage. There is no loan
//! condition in this judgment: [CAP-1] makes `own`, `&`, path overlap
//! [OWN-7] and the ordinary effect row the complete interference vocabulary,
//! so what a callee does through a reference is its declared row projected
//! onto the actual's path, which condition 2 already judges.
//!
//! # Why regrouping is admissible here and nowhere wider
//!
//! The adjacency rule never regroups anything: the combination tree of a pair
//! is written in the source, and permission only overlaps its two independent
//! halves. A loop rule is categorically stronger, because it lets the
//! implementation choose the tree. Two facts carry it:
//!
//! - Each admitted operation is a *total* function on its type's complete
//!   value set, carries no per-application obligation, and is associative and
//!   commutative there with a two-sided identity: `+wrap` and `*wrap` are the
//!   ring operations of the integers modulo two to the width, `iand`, `ior`,
//!   and `ixor` are the meet, join, and group operations of the bit vector,
//!   `imin` and `imax` are the meet and join of that type's total order, and
//!   `band`, `bor`, and `bxor` are the two-element cases of the same three.
//!   Fixing the leaf multiset therefore fixes the value of *every* binary
//!   tree over them. **No float operation is admitted.** `fadd.strict` is the
//!   pointed example: floating-point addition is not associative, so a
//!   schedule that regrouped it would move a published byte. `+`, `+defined`,
//!   `+checked`, and `+sat` are absent because each application carries an
//!   obligation, a `Result` route, or a clamp that regrouping moves.
//! - No entailment fact established inside one counted iteration survives to
//!   a later head or to the continuation, so a regrouped accumulator can
//!   falsify no surviving proof.
//!
//! **Invariant.** This judgment consults typing, declared effect rows,
//! resolved places [REF-1, OWN-7], and the statement graph's exit edges. For
//! the two element families it additionally consumes the successful [OP-4] and
//! [REF-4] dispositions and the exact value images already retained on the
//! checked function; it never repeats a bounds proof or reconstructs a value
//! from parser shape. Every form it has not classified refuses, and the
//! statement match is exhaustive for that reason: a missed statement would
//! contribute an empty footprint and *widen* permission.
