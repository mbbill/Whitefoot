//! The permission judgment [PAR-1]: whether two adjacent statements of one
//! block may be executed with their evaluations overlapped, and which runs of
//! adjacent statements may all overlap.
//!
//! P is a compiler-internal legality judgment. It refuses nothing, changes no
//! acceptance, and grants no lowering by itself; it records, per analyzed
//! block, which adjacent pairs may overlap and which runs the checked program
//! hands the backend as overlap groups.
//!
//! # The judgment
//!
//! [PAR-1] admits an overlap of two *adjacent* statements "exactly when the
//! first's write paths are disjoint from the second's read and write paths
//! and the second's write paths are disjoint from the first's, using the same
//! path-overlap and index/range-disjointness judgment as [EFF-5] and
//! [OWN-7]". Read/read overlap is admitted. There is no window of interposed
//! statements: two calls separated by a third statement are not adjacent, and
//! the run rule below is what lets all three overlap together.
//!
//! One statement's footprint has three halves:
//!
//! - **writes** — the places a call's declared `writes` row reaches through
//!   its actuals after [EFF-5] substitution, the place every by-value
//!   consumption empties ("a by-value consumption counts as a write of the
//!   argument's place"), the place a `set` names, and the binding a `let`
//!   defines ("a `let`'s defined binding is a write path"). That last clause
//!   is what makes ordinary dataflow a footprint conflict rather than a
//!   condition of its own: where the second statement reads what the first
//!   defines, the first's write path and the second's read path are one
//!   place.
//! - **reads** — the places a call's declared `reads` row reaches through the
//!   same substitution.
//! - **operand reads** — the storage the statement's own argument
//!   expressions touch on the calling thread. "Evaluating a statement's own
//!   argument expressions is part of that statement, so each statement's
//!   write paths must also be disjoint from the places the other statement's
//!   argument expressions read." Both directions are required, because which
//!   statement's operand evaluation an overlap moves is the implementation's
//!   choice of lane.
//!
//! Allocation and release contribute no path [STOR-8], so an allocating call
//! adds nothing here and never denies an adjacency on that ground.
//!
//! A footprint element whose caller place this analysis does not resolve
//! overlaps every place and denies permission, and a statement form whose
//! footprint this analysis does not compute denies for the same reason: a
//! missing element would *widen* permission, which is the one direction the
//! judgment must never fail in.
//!
//! # Runs
//!
//! "Permission composes: any run of adjacent statements that pairwise may
//! overlap may all overlap, and 'pairwise' means every ordered pair in the
//! run." A statement therefore joins the current run only after an exact
//! comparison with every earlier member. The pair identity matters: range
//! separation is proved in the flow state before that pair's first statement,
//! so an origin-free union could incorrectly reuse another pair's branch or
//! later fact. A greedy partition can lose an opportunity and can never
//! change a verdict, because permission is never an obligation.
//!
//! A run's members that are not calls carry no hand-out and leave the
//! parallel lowering's clone set untouched, as
//! `compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds` decides: only a handed-out call
//! has a lowering that differs between the two worlds, so a permitted
//! adjacency among ordinary statements is scheduling and alias metadata
//! rather than a new hand-out site.
//!
//! # Exit edges
//!
//! [PAR-1] v0.60 states no condition about exit edges, where v0.59 required
//! that "every normal continuation of s1 reaches s2". A statement whose
//! continuation may leave the block cannot be overlapped with the statement
//! written after it, because that statement may not execute at all and the
//! rule still promises that "bindings and every Whitefoot state place equal
//! the source-order result". This judgment therefore refuses an exit-bearing
//! statement, which is the fail-closed reading of a sentence the rule no
//! longer carries.
//!
//! # Proof statements
//!
//! Every source proof statement has already been checked against its
//! control-flow facts before permission metadata is built, and is erased
//! before lowering: it has no runtime evaluation, effect, exit edge, or
//! scheduler-visible event. A failed proof rejects the program instead of
//! creating a runtime fallback. The judgment therefore neither rechecks
//! proofs nor models a proof failure path, and a proof statement carries an
//! empty footprint.
//!
//! **Invariant.** This judgment consults typing, declared effect rows,
//! resolved places [REF-1, OWN-7], and statement-graph exit edges. It cannot
//! turn an accepted program into a rejected one or move a required check.
