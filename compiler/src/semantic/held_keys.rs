//! [SHARE-3] which statements holding a map's state reach its entries only
//! under keys that are known before their block runs, and the statements
//! that compute those keys.
//!
//! A statement holding a map's state takes effect at one point, and an
//! implementation may hold less than the statement holds wherever the
//! program's outcomes are those it has under the whole hold [SHARE-3]. So
//! when the block reaches the map only through
//! `atomic e = &s^[key] { ... }`, every such key can be computed first, and
//! no block of the program is a section others could see inside
//! ([`runs_object_sections`]), lowering collects the keys, and the runtime
//! holds those entries and no others (`wf_cmap_hold_set`). The block then
//! runs once, as written, on entries it already holds.
//!
//! The keys are computed by a *twin* of the block: its counted loops and
//! matches that contain such a statement, the `let`s their keys, bounds and
//! scrutinees read, and each such statement with an empty block. The twin
//! is sound when it computes at least the keys the block reaches. This
//! module answers a twin only when all of the following hold, and a
//! statement without a twin holds the whole map as before:
//!
//! - the block names the held state only as the target of such statements;
//! - no `return`, `break`, propagating `let` or `give` leaves any part of
//!   the block;
//! - a kept expression owes nothing the twin might not have: its integer
//!   operations and conversions answer for every operand, its calls have no
//!   `requires`, and a range it forms is narrowed to its source's bounds
//!   when the twin is lowered. The block proved such obligations under
//!   facts the twin, which drops the block's other statements, may lack: a
//!   guard arm that never returns, a call that does not. Where the block
//!   does form the range the narrowing changes nothing, so the twin still
//!   collects the block's key;
//! - no general loop contains such a statement, since a twin without the
//!   loop's exits would not end;
//! - the block runs at most one statement on a shared object
//!   ([`one_object_statement`]), and so does every other block of the
//!   program that holds an entry or a map's state
//!   ([`runs_object_sections`]): a block that runs two is a section that no
//!   statement on the map enters, or sees the middle of, only while whole
//!   maps are held;
//! - every kept expression is a constant, a binding read, a field of one,
//!   such an integer operation or conversion, a float or boolean operation,
//!   a range's measure, a range over a range or over a constant, or a call
//!   to a function that
//!   waits for nothing, writes nothing, allocates nothing, returns an owned
//!   value and reaches no function without a body other than a pure one, so
//!   that it answers the same in the twin and in the block;
//! - no kept call follows the block's object statement in source order, so
//!   that a call that never returns stops the twin no earlier than it would
//!   stop the block after that statement's effect;
//! - nothing the kept expressions read is written between the twin and the
//!   block's end: a binding they read is never the root of a `set` in the
//!   block, never released or consumed there, has no address taken in the
//!   function, and a reference they read through names only parameters the
//!   function's row does not write [EFF-2].
//!
//! Each condition errs toward no twin. The runtime stops a program whose
//! block reaches a key its twin did not collect, which only a defect here
//! could cause.
