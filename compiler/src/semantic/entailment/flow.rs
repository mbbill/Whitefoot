//! [ENT-3] flow of facts over the conservative structural graph [FN-1], with
//! [ENT-5] kills, joins, and the no-induction loop rule, and [ENT-6]
//! obligation discharge with residual rendering.
//!
//! The walker carries the live fact state forward through the checked
//! statement tree, which is the structural graph: statements sequence, match
//! arms fork and join, loops iterate through their break edges, and
//! `return`/`give`/`break`/`propagate` leave scopes on edges. Scope-exit
//! kills always apply on the edge, before any join at the edge's target.
//!
//! The analysis is divided along its writers
//! (`design/compiler/engine-components.md`). [`Input`] is what it reads and
//! never changes; [`Vocabulary`] holds the terms, goals, affine atoms and the
//! one derivation ledger every judgment is stated in; [`Output`] is what it
//! publishes; [`Frames`] belongs to the one walk. A method takes the narrowest
//! of these its work needs: [`Reasoning`] lends the inputs and the vocabulary
//! to forming, closing and proving, [`Judging`] adds the outputs a judgment
//! is recorded in, and [`Analyzer`] owns all four for the walk.
//!
//! This module holds those types, the per-path states and the entry points.
//! The components are its children: the fact [`domain`] and its joins, kill
//! and scope [`events`], [`goals`], the one [`prover`] dispatcher, the
//! [`judge`]ments, the [ENT-3] fact [`sources`] with Result transport in
//! [`results`], conversions in [`conversions`] and the [ENT-3.S7] operation
//! table in [`operation_facts`], [`postconditions`], loop [`invariants`],
//! [PRF-1] [`certificates`], the [`walk`], the [`loop_summary`], and
//! canonical [`render`]ing.
