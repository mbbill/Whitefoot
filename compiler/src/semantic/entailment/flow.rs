//! [ENT-3] flow of facts over the conservative structural graph [FN-1], with
//! [ENT-5] kills, joins, and the no-induction loop rule, and [ENT-6]
//! obligation discharge with residual rendering.
//!
//! The walker carries the live fact state forward through the checked
//! statement tree, which is the structural graph: statements sequence, match
//! arms fork and join, loops iterate through their break edges, and
//! `return`/`give`/`break`/`propagate` leave scopes on edges. Scope-exit
//! kills always apply on the edge, before any join at the edge's target.
//!
//! The [ENT-3] fact sources themselves — which checked shape establishes
//! which relation — live in [`sources`]; this module owns the graph, the
//! kills, the joins, and the obligation judgment, and calls into the sources
//! at each establishment point.
