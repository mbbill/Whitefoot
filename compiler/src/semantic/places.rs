//! [REF-1] resolved places and the [OWN-7] overlap relation.
//!
//! A resolved place is a root — a local variable, a parameter, or a named
//! const [CONST-2] — and the ordered steps below it: field selections,
//! `deref` of `Box` content [TYPE-7], enum payload steps, index steps, range
//! steps [REF-4], window parts [WIN-2] and measure reads [OP-15]. That is the
//! one path type in the checker; a reference variable is not storage of its
//! own, so resolving a place rooted at one replaces that root by the path the
//! reference names, recursively [REF-1].
//!
//! [OWN-7] is the single relation every consumer asks: the call-site pairwise
//! comparison [EFF-5], reference invalidation [REF-2], the [ENT-5] kills, and
//! the [PAR-1] adjacency footprints. Two places fail to overlap exactly when
//! some step of their common prefix provably selects two different storages,
//! and a pair no admitted family separates is overlapping. Nothing here may
//! grow a private second copy of that relation.
//!
//! Three of the separations [OWN-7] admits are proofs rather than syntax —
//! two index steps proved distinct by the fixed [ENT-6] families under
//! [MSR-4]'s disposition, two range steps proved disjoint by the four
//! non-strict orderings, and an index step proved outside a range step by
//! three. Those reach the entailment fragment through [`SeparationOracle`]
//! and nothing else. A path's captured index and endpoint values are immutable
//! once captured [REF-1, OWN-7], while the proof that separates two such
//! values is available only along the control-flow edges it dominates.
