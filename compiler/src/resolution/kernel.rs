//! The three compiler-owned storage nominals [TYPE-9], the cell identity they
//! share a reader with, and their [TYPE-6] lookup classes.
//!
//! x1 makes all four of them prelude records. [TYPE-2] and [PRE-1] declare
//! `Array`, `Slots`, `Ring` and `Box` as opaque structs, parsed like every
//! other prelude record, so each contributes its nominal-type entry, its
//! refused constructor entry and its fields through the ordinary declaration
//! path, and a source declaration of the same spelling is the ordinary PRE-1
//! collision.
//!
//! What survives in this module is their *identity*. A written `Array<T, n>`
//! or `Box<T>` names one compiler-owned shape rather than a source struct,
//! because only the identity carries what a struct body cannot state: the
//! element storage, the omitted-capacity form and the [MSR-1] measure row.
//! Resolution maps each of those four declarations onto its
//! [`ContainerNominalId`] through [`container_nominal_id`], and every later
//! stage reads the shapes and the cell exactly where it read them before.
//!
//! [BLK-0]'s kernel declaration domain is gone in v0.60: the construction
//! functions [OP-13] and the window operations [OP-10] are ordinary [PRE-1]
//! records parsed by the same grammar as source declarations, so this module
//! carries no operation table any more.
