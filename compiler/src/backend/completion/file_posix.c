/* The monotonic clock, which is a host call and therefore this leaf's.

 * the bridge's bounded look at its own record before it announces sleep. Both
 * are shared code, so the clock is declared in `file_adapter.h` beside the
 * execution leaf and answered here.
 *
 * WF_FILE_MONOTONIC_NS is a named seam of the same class as WF_COMPLETION_PREAD
 * and WF_COMPLETION_POLL: a build may answer it with a scripted clock so that
 * the growth rule can be tested for what it decides rather than for how fast
 * the machine running the test happened to be.  The shipped build reads the
 * host monotonic clock and nothing else. */
