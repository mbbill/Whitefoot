/*
 * The Windows host leaf of the file adapter: one host call per request kind,
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * `file_adapter.c` owns the queue, the helpers, the claim and the progress
 * pass, and is one implementation for every platform.  This unit is the one
 * thing that cannot be, and `file_posix.c` is its twin.  Every call it makes is
 * one of `windows_runtime.c`'s workers, so the NtCreateFile relative open, the
 * WriteFile with the stream's own current position, and the directory batch are
 * written once each and reached from here.
 *
 * What this target does *not* qualify is refused as an outcome rather than as
 * a terminated process.  The emitter emits the whole seven-entry submit ABI on
 * every target and the Windows row admits an open, a positioned read, a stream
 * write, a close, a directory batch and the six TCP kinds; a shape the row does
 * not admit reaches this switch and is published as a failed operation with the
 * host's own refusal code, exactly as `wf_bridge_complete_refused` publishes an
 * offset the target ABI cannot express.
 *
 * The socket arms are Winsock calls and nothing else, and they are the twin of
 * `file_posix.c`'s in exactly the sense this unit is that unit's twin: the
 * address conversion, the backlog, the send flags and the pair's two-count are
 * shared (`socket_address.h`, `file_adapter.c`), and what is written here is
 * the call.  A socket reached from this unit is a *blocking* socket:
 * `WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` says the completion port may carry a request issued
 * with an `OVERLAPPED`, and says nothing about a call made without one, so
 * `recv`, `send`, `accept` and `connect` here wait on the helper thread the
 * bounded adapter exists to supply and post no packet to any port the handle
 * is bound to.  That is why the `hEvent` low-bit rule the positioned read
 * needs has no counterpart here: this unit issues no overlapped socket
 * request.

 * above MAXDWORD, a negative offset, a descriptor of a class it does not
 * carry.  So the handle read here may well be one the port already has, and
 * this call says so rather than hoping otherwise.
 *
 * The offset travels in an `OVERLAPPED` because that is how a Windows read
 * names one.  The event beside it is this call's own, so two reads of one
 * handle cannot take each other's completion -- and its low-order bit is set,
 * which is the documented way to say that this one operation posts no packet
 * to whatever completion port the handle is bound to.  Without that bit a read
 * here on a bound handle would deliver its completion to the ring's port, and
 * the reaper would recover a "record" by subtraction from an `OVERLAPPED` that
 * is a local of this frame.  A handle value with its low bits set still names
 * the same object to every wait, so `GetOverlappedResult` below is unaffected;

 * logic here.
 *
 * A console handle is not opened for overlapped I/O and has no overlapped
 * form at all, so `ReadFile` with a null `OVERLAPPED` is the only thing that
 * reads it; that call advances the console's own position and blocks this
 * helper's thread until the user supplies a line, which is exactly what the
 * bounded adapter's helper thread exists for.
 *
 * A redirected pipe or file is the same call. A pipe handle the process
 * inherited is likewise not opened overlapped, so a null `OVERLAPPED` reads it
 * at its own position and returns when the writer supplies bytes or closes;
 * a redirected regular file also advances the handle's own file pointer, which
 * is what an unpositioned read means. Passing an `OVERLAPPED` here would be
 * wrong in both cases rather than faster: on a synchronous handle Windows
 * ignores it for the wait and still uses the offset it carries, which would
 * turn a stream read into a positioned read at zero and re-read the first
 * bytes forever.
 *
 * End of stream is a successful zero-byte read in this contract. A pipe whose
 * writer closed reports `ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE`, which is that end and not a
 * failure, so it is normalized to zero here exactly as a file's
