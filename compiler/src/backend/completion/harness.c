/* ------------------------------------------------------------- retirements
 *
 * Retired with the record pool (design §7, "The record's pool machinery:
 * deleted, not answered").  Every property each of these asserted was a
 * property of that pool, and the pool is gone rather than answered: the record
 * is a block of the submitting frame, nothing claims it, nothing recycles it,
 * and no queue anywhere can refuse an operation.
 *
 *   - `test_capacity_and_product_state`: the slot phases, the milestone
 *     product and WF_COMPLETION_OWNERSHIP_COMPLETE.  A record has one state
 *     that goes PENDING to DONE once, and no product of independent facts.
 *   - `test_generation_and_duplicate_terminal`: the generation and the
 *     duplicate-terminal refusal.  Exactly one terminal per submission is now
 *     an impossibility rather than a checked refusal, and it is tested in its
 *     new form by `test_exactly_one_completion_per_submission_under_race`.
 *   - `test_named_drain_refuses_a_recycled_slot`: a recycled slot.  There is
 *     no slot and no recycling; the frame joins its record before any
 *     terminator, so no publisher can meet a reused one.
 *   - `test_concurrent_single_claims_are_unique`: claim uniqueness.  There is
 *     nothing to claim; each frame supplies its own record, which is what the
 *     race test above submits from many threads at once.
 *   - `test_bounded_drain_and_lane_independence`: the bounded drain and the
 *     ready-event count it moved.  A completion is published straight into its
 *     record and there is no event to drain.
 *   - `test_drain_wakes_the_registered_token_owner`: the consume-wait
 *     registration.  Its property -- a completion elsewhere wakes the thread
 *     that registered for it -- survives as the in-place waiter, and is tested
 *     by `test_a_completion_claims_an_in_place_registration` and
 *     `test_a_helper_completion_wakes_a_waiting_join`.
 *   - `test_bridge_capacity_falls_back_per_operation` and
 *     `test_open_capacity_refuses_and_resubmits`: the per-operation capacity
 *     fallback and the readmission after a release.  There is no capacity to
 *     exhaust, no refusal to fall back from, and the owner's rule forbids a
 *     per-operation blocking fallback; the property that replaces both is
 *     `test_more_operations_outstanding_than_the_old_capacity`.
 *   - `test_capacity_release_wakes_before_blocking_work`: the capacity
 *     notification and the ordering it bought.  `wf_completion_notify_capacity`
 *     and its six callers are deleted with the capacity they announced.
 *   - `test_a_name_no_record_can_hold_opens_directly`: the path-does-not-fit
 *     demotion and its counter.  An open's path bytes are the submitting
 *     frame's own and are never copied, so no name can be too long for a
 *     record; the property that replaces it is
 *     `test_a_name_no_pool_record_could_hold_takes_the_completion_path`.
 *   - The overwrite arm of `test_submitted_open_owns_its_path_bytes`, which
 *     rewrote the caller's buffer immediately after submitting.  The bytes are
 *     the frame's and [SYS-2]'s loan on them holds until the join (design §5),
 *     so rewriting them while the operation is outstanding is no longer a
 *     thing a conforming caller does; what remains -- that an open resolves
 *     the name it was given -- is asserted by
 *     `test_submitted_open_resolves_the_submitters_bytes`.

 * is.  A case that asserts an upper bound above one therefore asserts nothing
 * under that driver -- the bound is not approached, let alone reached, and

 * entry per helper ever leaves the queue, so after `i` submissions the queue
 * holds at least `i - held` entries and every submission past twice the
 * current pool size finds `queue_count > held` and adds a helper.  Growth
 * then stops only where the cap stops it, which is the question both cases
 * below ask.
 *

 * requires a measured wait and an adapter that has executed nothing has
 * measured none.  Its execution is the sampled one -- the interval starts at
 * the first -- and the caller performs it, because the pool is still empty.
 * The pipe is fed the rest of its bytes only after the pool count has been

/* An I/O join made on a pool stack parks that stack, and the completion
 * resumes it.
 *
 * This is design §11 item 1 in its real-thread form, and the case above in the
 * shape a linked program actually runs: there the join is made from a plain
 * harness thread with no stack to park, so it takes §2's fourth line and waits
 * in place; here the thread enters the core the way `sched/smoke.c` does, the
 * join has a stack, and §2's third line parks it.
 *
 * The operation is completed by a thread of this case's own rather than by an
 * engine, and that is what makes the park unconditional. A record the bounded
 * adapter still holds is run by the joining thread itself, which is the engine
 * doing its job and not a park; a record in the ring is reaped by whichever
 * thread makes the next progress pass. Which of those a real read takes
 * depends on the helper policy and on whether this host has io_uring, so a
 * case that submitted one would assert a park on some gate hosts and not
 * others. A record only another thread can publish takes §2's third line on
 * every host and every helper setting, and it is the same record, the same
 * join entry point and the same publication call
 * (`wf_completion_record_complete`) an operation of any kind ends in.
 *
 * What the counters say is the whole property. `parks` above zero says the
 * stack really parked rather than spinning to DONE; `resumes` equal to `parks`
 * says every parked stack came back; and the join returned the record's own
 * result, so the stack that was resumed is the stack that joined. The
 * publisher sleeps first, so a join that did not park would have to spin on a
 * record nothing had completed: a park that was never resumed is a hang the
 * watchdog reports by name.
 *
 * Three stacks and one thread: the entry takes one, so a park has one to
 * switch to and the exhausted arm is not what is being tested. The core is the
 * process's own `wf__sched_core`, which nothing has started here -- a harness
 * link carries no floor, so no entry started it -- and it stays initialised for
 * the cases after this one, whose joins run on plain threads and wait in place
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * A compute hand-out joined newest-first on the core from a linked program is
 * not duplicated here: `compiler/tests/programs/parallel.rs` runs whole
 * compiled programs whose overlap groups do exactly that, at several worker
 * counts, and reads the core's own grant count back. */
