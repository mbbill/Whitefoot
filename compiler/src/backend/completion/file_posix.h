 * The POSIX file leaf's own vocabulary: the rules that read a host `stat` mode
 * and a host open flag, and the WF_IO_NOCACHE policy's one host call.
 *
 * These were inline in `file_adapter.h` while that header was POSIX's alone.
 * They are here now because they name `<sys/stat.h>` and `<fcntl.h>`, and the
 * adapter's own header is shared with a platform that has neither.  Their two
 * readers are both POSIX leaves: `file_posix.c`, the adapter's per-operation
 * host switch, and `linux_io_uring.c`, which decides a ring-completed open's
 * kind with the same rule so that one open states one contract whichever
 * engine ran it.
 *
 * The address vocabulary this header used to hold is `socket_address.h`'s
 * now, because the Windows engines convert the same value against the same
 * layout and a second copy of that rule would be a twin of a shared unit.
 * What is left here is what genuinely differs: the POSIX open flags, the
 * POSIX kind rule, and the POSIX socket call.

/* WF_IO_NOCACHE: a target policy that makes a program's reads genuinely wait.
 *
 * This is runtime policy of the same class as WF_IO_HELPERS and WF_WORKERS,
 * not a language surface. No Whitefoot source names it, no accepted program
 * changes meaning under it, and no byte any read produces differs with it
 * set: it asks the host to keep this file's pages out of its cache, which
 * changes only how long a read takes. Absent — and any value other than the
 * exact text "1" — is today's behaviour exactly, with no host call made at
 * all.
 *
 * It exists because every file measurement in docs/done/0084 and 0086 ran
 * against a warm page cache, where a read is a memory copy and a completion
 * model that overlaps waits has nothing to overlap. Measuring the completion
 * framework needs reads that wait on a device.
 *
 * Darwin gets F_NOCACHE, which is a mode of the descriptor: every read
 * through it bypasses the unified buffer cache for the whole life of the
 * open. Linux has no such per-descriptor mode, so it gets one
 * POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED of the whole file, which evicts what is cached at the
 * moment of the open. O_DIRECT is deliberately not used: it constrains
 * buffer address, offset, and length alignment, which would change the
 * program's own buffers and so change what is being measured.
 *
 * The setting is read once per process and cached. Two threads that race here
 * compute the same answer from the same environment, so the race is benign. */
