/*
 * The address vocabulary every socket engine shares [SYS-16, SYS-17].
 *
 * A `SocketAddress` crosses the ABI as the three scalars of its emitted
 * layout (`contract.h`, `wf_socket_address`), and every engine that makes a
 * host call has to turn that into the host's own address record and back
 * again: `file_posix.c` for the queued and inline routes, `linux_io_uring.c`
 * for the ring's connect and accept, `file_windows.c` for the Windows adapter
 * route, and `windows_iocp.c` for the completion port's connect.  So the
 * conversions live here, once, and one address states one contract whichever
 * engine ran the operation.
 *
 * The only thing that differs by platform is which header declares the host's
 * address records and its byte-order calls.  Their names, their fields and
 * their layouts are the same on both, so the rules below are one text: an
 * address is a value, and no host call is made here.
 *
 * This header was `file_posix.h`'s until the Windows routes landed.  It is not
 * a twin of that header: the POSIX leaf includes this one and keeps only what
 * `<fcntl.h>` and `<sys/stat.h>` give it.
