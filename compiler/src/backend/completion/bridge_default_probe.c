 * The bridge on its shipped default helper policy, which nothing else runs.
 *
 * `harness.c`'s main pins WF_IO_HELPERS for any invocation that did not name
 * one, and `completion-test` names 0, 1 and 4, so the policy a delivered
 * program actually gets -- a pool that starts empty and grows only once the
 * adapter has measured its own operations waiting, and a positioned read the
 * bridge declines to submit while there is nothing to overlap it with -- was
 * reachable from no test in the tree.  Both halves of that policy are new in
 * batch 0096 and both choose between two different routes for the same
 * writer-visible operation, which is exactly the decision a test has to watch.
 *
 * So this probe runs with WF_IO_HELPERS unset, on purpose, and refuses to run
 * with it set: an inherited value would silently turn it back into the arm the
 * harness already covers.
 *
 * What it asserts of each read is what a writer can observe and nothing else:
 * every read delivers the byte that is at its offset, with the count and error
 * the operation promises, whichever route the bridge chose for it -- and the
 * run finishes, which is the liveness half, since running an operation inside
 * submit and growing the pool are both decisions about who executes the work.
 *
 * There is no declined submission any more: every submit ends in a published
 * record, and the branch that used to hand the operation back to its caller
 * now executes it inside submit and publishes it there
 * (`research/investigations/io-model/PARK-ON-MISS.md` §7, "Every submit path
 * ends in a published record").  The branch is still watched, through the
 * runtime's count of operations the engine executed inside the submitting
 * call.
 *
 * It then asserts that the routes it exists to watch were taken at all, which
 * is the difference between covering a decision and counting it: see the
 * route check at the end of `main`.

     * machine runs about 15 700 of 16 000 reads inline when the host is quiet
     * and runs none inline while growing three helpers when it is loaded,
     * because under a sanitizer on a busy machine a one-byte read really does
     * cost more than the twenty microseconds the rule is asking about.
     * Requiring the inline branch would therefore be requiring the host to be
