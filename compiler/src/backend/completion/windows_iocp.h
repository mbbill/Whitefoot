/*
 * The Windows kernel completion ring, in the same shape as `linux_io_uring.h`.
 *
 * It finds the record by address: the `OVERLAPPED` a request is issued with is
 * embedded in the frame's own completion record, so the completion packet's
 * `OVERLAPPED` pointer *is* the record's identity, exactly as a CQE's
 * `user_data` is on Linux (design
 * `research/investigations/io-model/PARK-ON-MISS.md` §7, "What survives, and
 * the one change inside it").  There is no entry pool, no token, no
 * generation, and therefore no capacity this ring can refuse for.
 *
 * Its wait is the one park the bridge supplies through the
 * `wf__sched_host_epoch` / `_park` / `_wake` seam on Windows (§7, platform item
 * 2): the completion port itself, with a wake delivered as a
 * `PostQueuedCompletionStatus` packet, so a ready stack and an I/O completion
 * arrive on one queue. New park calls use the same epoch's condition variable
 * until an older notified cohort has finished consuming its port packets.
