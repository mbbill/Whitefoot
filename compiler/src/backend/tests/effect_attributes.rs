//! Tripwire on the LLVM function attributes the backend is allowed to emit.
//!
//! The backend emits no function attributes today, so the assertion below is
//! currently satisfied without the emitter doing anything. That is the point:
//! it is a canary for the effect-attribute channel that a future change will
//! open when it starts translating Whitefoot effect rows (`pure`, `reads`,
//! `writes`, `allocates`) into LLVM attributes. It must fail on the day anyone
//! emits `willreturn`, before the resulting miscompile reaches a program.
//!
//! Why `willreturn` specifically, and why not just the combination:
//!
//! [EFF-3] of the active kernel specification says `pure` "licenses
//! deduplication and reordering of calls with equal arguments. Elimination of
//! an unused pure call additionally requires a termination proof; v0 provides
//! no termination checker, so unused pure calls are not eliminated. `pure`
//! excludes all reads/writes/allocates; it does not promise termination."
//! `willreturn` is exactly the termination promise the language
//! does not make, so emitting it asserts something v0 cannot prove.
//!
//! The tripwire is on `willreturn` because it is the attribute no v0 effect row
//! can license. `nounwind` and a narrow `memory(...)` class can eventually be
//! derived from effects, but termination requires its own proof. Do not delete
//! this test as vacuous: it is meant to be silent until the channel opens.
//!
//! The check is on the module the backend emits, not on the module the host
//! optimizer returns. Do not "strengthen" it to the optimized module: the host
//! optimizer infers and writes its own attribute groups (an `-O2` run over
//! `tests/programs/recursive_tree.wf` yields eight `willreturn` occurrences,
//! including on declared allocation helpers), which is LLVM reasoning about its
//! own IR and is not this compiler making a promise. What this test controls is
//! what the backend asserts.
