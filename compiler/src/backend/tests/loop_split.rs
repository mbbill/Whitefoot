//! Actualization of a permitted counted loop [PAR-2 candidate]: what a split
//! loop emits, what each world runs, and what the program observes.
//!
//! The property this module exists to check is the same one the pair path makes —
//! overlapping changes nothing observable — with one thing added that the pair
//! path never does: the *shape* of the combination tree is chosen by the
//! runtime rather than written in the source. So the byte comparisons here span
//! worker counts that produce genuinely different trees, and the differential
//! against the unsplit lowering is what says the tree does not matter.
//!
//! A run at `WF_WORKERS=1` proves nothing about overlapping — it takes the
//! sequential world — so the cases that need real overlap read the runtime's
//! own grant count and refuse a repeat that never actually handed anything out.
//!
//! # Kernel spec v0.60
//!
//! No test in this module retired. Every subject here is [PAR-2]'s counted
//! permission and the lowering that actualizes it, and [PAR-2] survives the
//! amendment: what changed under it is how a statement's footprint is spelled,
//! not which loops may split. The `.wf` fixtures were retargeted:
//!
//! - `region { .. }` wrappers are gone with regions themselves [OWN-3, OWN-4,
//!   OWN-10, FORM-8]; their statements stay in the enclosing block. Nothing is
//!   lost, because loans and arenas contribute no footprint any more and
//!   [STOR-8] gives allocation and release no effect entry at all, so neither
//!   can stop two statements from overlapping [PAR-1].
//! - `buffer_new(count, value)` became [OP-13]'s `box_array_filled` over the
//!   one heap [STOR-8], and `array_new` became `array_filled`.
//! - `slice_of` / `mut_slice_of` and the types `Slice<T>` / `MutSlice<T>`
//!   retired with [VIEW-1] and [VIEW-4]. The successor is [REF-4]'s range
//!   reference `&x[lo..hi]` carried by the parameter kind `&[T]`, whose
//!   disjointness is [OWN-7]'s four non-strict range orderings - the same
//!   judgment [PAR-1] and [PAR-2] now name directly.
//! - `len_of(p)` became [OP-15]'s measure member read `p.len`, a place form
//!   and not a call.
//! - `&uniq p` became the one reference spelling `&p`; whether a callee writes
//!   through it is stated by its effect row [EFF-1], and `writes` subsumes
//!   `reads` for one path, so `reads(d), writes(d)` collapses to `writes(d)`.
//!
//! [`map_and_reduction_source`] now takes its eight-byte speller from
//! [`COMBINE_PRELUDE`] instead of splicing it out of the `range_fold.wf`
//! program fixture. The two were byte-identical; taking the one this module
//! owns keeps the generated fixture on the spec version the module is written
//! against.
