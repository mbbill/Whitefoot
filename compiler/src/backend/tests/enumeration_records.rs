//! The [SYS-14] portable-record decoder, over native records this module
//! builds by hand.
//!
//! `directory_next` is the one system operation whose emitted shim reads a
//! record the host wrote rather than a count the host returned, and the two
//! qualified families write different records: Darwin's `struct dirent`
//! states the name's length in a field of its own, and Linux's
//! `struct linux_dirent64` states none at all and NUL-terminates the name
//! inside the extent `d_reclen` reports. The decoder must therefore be
//! exercised against names of every admitted length, against every native
//! entry kind, and against records no correct kernel produces — an extent
//! that does not advance, an extent reaching past the reported batch, a name
//! that does not fit the record carrying it. A real directory cannot be made
//! to produce the last group on demand.
//!
//! The substitution is the one `compiler/Makefile` already uses for the
//! completion harness: the file adapter reaches its family's enumeration
//! facility through a macro, and these cases define that macro to a function
//! this module writes. Nothing else changes. The bootstrap still opens the
//! real working directory, `open_directory_source` still opens a real
//! descriptor against it, and the decoder under test is the shipped emitted
//! shim reading the bytes the scripted facility left in the caller's own
//! buffer.
