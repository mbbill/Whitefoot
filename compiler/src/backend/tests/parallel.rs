//! Parallel compiler internals: frame/clone/ABI emission, native object
//! observations and controlled runtime boundaries. Complete tree/spine/window
//! results live in programs; native construction is explicit in these helpers.
//!
//! # Kernel spec v0.60
//!
//! [PAR-1] survives the amendment and was rewritten around it: two adjacent
//! statements of one block may overlap exactly when their write paths are
//! disjoint from each other's read and write paths, judged by the same
//! path-overlap and index/range-disjointness relation as [EFF-5] and [OWN-7].
//! Loans and arenas contribute no footprint any more, and [STOR-8] gives
//! allocation and release no effect entry at all, so neither can deny an
//! overlap. The lowering cases below therefore keep their subject; their `.wf`
//! fixtures were retargeted: `region { .. }` wrappers deleted with regions
//! [OWN-3, OWN-4, OWN-10, FORM-8], `array<T, N>` spelled `Array<T, n>` and
//! built by [OP-13]'s `array_filled`, `buffer_new(count, value)` replaced by
//! [OP-13]'s `box_array_filled` over the one heap [STOR-8] whose content is
//! the field `inner` [TYPE-9], `slice_of` replaced by
//! [REF-4]'s range reference `&x[lo..hi]` at the parameter kind `&[T]`,
//! `len_of(p)` replaced by [OP-15]'s member read `p.len`, `&uniq` replaced by
//! the one reference spelling `&`, and an effect row on a by-value parameter
//! dropped entirely, because [EFF-1] roots every entry at a reference
//! parameter and a row rooted at an `own` parameter is a rejection.
//!
//! One test retired:
//!
//! - `heap_box_loop_keeps_provider_order_and_updates_borrowed_owners` retired
//!   with [PROV-1] and [BLK-0] through [BLK-4]: its whole subject was a
//!   store-provider program - a `Heap<'heap>` parameter, an `allocates(heap)`
//!   effect entry, region-parameterized `Box<'s, u64>` cells - whose
//!   observation was a per-allocation refusal schedule, refusing each of eight
//!   `heap_box` calls in turn and reading the `Err` arm the writer had to
//!   spell. [STOR-8] makes allocation total over one heap: no construction
//!   returns a `Result`, exhaustion terminates from the trusted base outside
//!   the language, and allocation carries no effect entry, so there is no
//!   refusal arm to schedule and nothing left of the ordering this case
//!   observed. The successors are [STOR-8] for the one heap and the absent
//!   effect category, [OP-9] for the allocation-size obligation now checked at
//!   the source, [OP-11] `swap(first: &a, second: &b)` for the two-place
//!   exchange the helper spelled `set (a, b) = move b, move a;` [SET-2], and
//!   [WIN-3] for the release of a displaced affine owner. Per-element release
//!   ordering of a boxed affine run is kept by `heap_programs` and
//!   `resource_enums`; the lane-side owner accounting this case shared with
//!   `owned_pair_results_survive_ordinary_join_and_forced_refusal` stays in
//!   [`run_owned_lane_cases`], which that case still drives.
