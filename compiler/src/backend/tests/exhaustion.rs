//! The resource-exhaustion floor: what an execution does when it runs out.
//!
//! Running out of stack or heap needs no source defect at all and, before this
//! floor, produced zero bytes and a bare host signal. These cases pin the
//! deliberately deferred resource-availability behavior without turning it
//! into a source proof obligation.
//!
//! Two separate obligations live here and must not be confused:
//!
//! - *containment* — a frame larger than the guard region walks its pages on
//!   the way down, so it cannot step over the guard into whatever is mapped
//!   below. This is a safety property, not a reporting one: without it an
//!   accepted program can silently overwrite a neighbouring thread's live
//!   stack. [`every_generated_definition_carries_the_stack_probe`] is its
//!   case.
//! - *reporting* — exhaustion ends the process by a defined abort that first
//!   writes one fixed record naming only the resource class. The record
//!   carries no `rule_id`, no function, and no node path.
//!
//! Compiler-generated probes, allocation edges and cleanup stay here. Pure C
//! floor setup, signal classification, stack provisioning and record-latch
//! observations live in `floor_probe.c`, under the common native test target.
//! Record bytes are a runtime implementation contract; SCOPE-3 keeps resource
//! availability outside the source outcome model.
//!
//! Allocation is total in the source language [STOR-8]; heap exhaustion ends
//! the process inside the trusted base. The tests below cover the resource
//! record and abort edges for scalar, array, Slots and Ring cells, cleanup of
//! initialized elements before their backing allocation, probe attachment to
//! every emitted definition, and native containment on a guarded stack.
