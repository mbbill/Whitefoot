// Native ownership evidence for the owning-map program, at v0.60.
//
// Retired subject: the allocation-refusal sweep this observer used to drive by
// returning NULL from the replaced `malloc` at each position in turn. [STOR-8]
// makes allocation total in the source -- it never returns a failure and never
// traps -- and the emitted module now answers a null allocation by calling
// `wf_resource_abort` and falling into `unreachable`, so a refusal has no
// source-visible subject and the program has no refusal exit code to check.
// Successor: the identity half below, which is the part an exit code still
// cannot provide -- every owner is a distinct allocation, still carries the
// value its own `box_new` was given when it is released, and is released
// exactly once, with nothing left live at exit.
//
// The payload check is what makes this an identity check rather than an
// allocation count. `exercise(seed)` runs twelve `allocate_put` calls in
// source order, each one `box_new::<u64>(value: v)` over the twelve values in
// `payloads` below, and `main` runs it for the sixteen seeds 0..16, so
// allocation `id` carries `payloads[(id - 1) % 12]`. The map moves those
// owners through swaps, tombstones, a replacement and a recycle; [STOR-7]
// lets any of that copy bytes between places, and [TYPE-9] keeps the content
// in the one heap object the `Box` owns throughout, so the value read back at
// the free must be the value that owner was constructed with. A map that
// crossed two owners over passes every count and fails here.
//
// The twelfth allocation of each seed is the genuinely full table's
// `Full(offered: back)`: `put` returns the owner it was offered rather than
// installing it, so that owner is released while it is still the newest
// request and carries 999.
