/* How long a lane with nothing to run stays hot before it parks. Two numbers
 * answer that: how often the lane may reconsider, and how long it goes on
 * reconsidering.
 *
 * HOW OFTEN is a count of misses, and it is unchanged. A lane should not pay
 * for a sleep in order to save less than the sleep costs, so the count is only
 * meaningful against what a round costs and what a park costs, and both are
 * measured by wake_probe.c on the host the choice is made for. Re-measured at
 * this revision on 2026-09-12, on a four-CPU Linux development host, that
 * probe reads a park-and-wake of 10.3 us -- the median of seven runs of 2,000
 * alternating parks through this file's own wf__par_signal and
 * wf_prim_wait_sleep -- and a spin-round floor of 11.6 ns, the median of the
 * same seven runs, uncontended at four lanes, so 1,024 rounds is about 11.9
 * us. (The reading this comment carried before, taken on 2026-09-11 on another
 * machine of that class, was 16.3 us and 18.9 ns, about 19.4 us for 1,024
 * rounds. The probe is run per host rather than inherited for exactly that
 * spread.)
 *
 * What the round figure is: the probe times wf__par_find alone, the FULL SCAN,
 * which is the round of a lane that has not yet reached the first spin bound.
 * It brackets a real round rather than equalling one. A real round also issues
 * wf_prim_spin_hint(), which the probe does not, so an ungated round costs
 * somewhat more than the floor; and past the first bound inside the window the
 * publish epoch below replaces the scan with a single counter load, so a gated
 * round costs less. Both regimes are far below a monotonic clock read, which is
 * why the window below is sampled once per 1,024 rounds and this count is now
 * the window's resolution rather than the whole of a lane's patience. It is
 * also why a changed round cost is not a separate variable: the window is
 * measured on the clock, so a cheaper or dearer round moves the sampling
 * interval and not how long a lane stays hot. Re-measure both numbers before
 * moving the count.
 *
 * HOW LONG is a time, and it depends on whether the pool fits the machine.
 * On the hosted ubuntu-24.04 runners -- two cores, two SMT siblings each, four
 * online CPUs -- a lane that parks on a condvar and is woken by a publisher
 * comes back slow. The per-call evidence is in the raw.tsv of run 34631106340.
 * Fir at W=2, each call against the fastest call of its own pass: the first
 * call reads 1.31 to 2.21, and in three of the five passes calls one through
 * four are still 1.06 to 1.98. Its first pass spends 8.5, 7.6 and 6.5 ms on
 * the first three calls against 3.8 ms on the last, while process CPU rises
 * 2.04 times against the wall's 2.21 -- so the extra wall is two lanes running
 * slowly, not one lane waiting. The `static` reference, whose helpers busy-wait
 * and never sleep, reads 1.21 to 1.24 on its first call and 1.00 to 1.04 on
 * every call after, in every pass. The reading is that the woken lane is
 * placed next to its waker until the load balancer separates them; what is
 * measured is that it costs the first few calls of every process, tens of
 * milliseconds, and that the arm which never sleeps does not pay it.
 *
 * Two twins measured what a longer window is worth. Lanes that never park
 * (spin bound 10^9, run 34631106340) took mandelbrot's W=4 paired wall to
 * 0.922 of the shipped runtime with four of five pairs lower and fir's W=2 to
 * 0.934 with four of five, and collapsed once the pool no longer fit: at eight
 * lanes on four CPUs they read 2.699, 2.945, 3.487 and 6.702. A 16,384-round
 * bound (run 34632558439) kept the saving in CPU where the pool did fit --
 * paired CPU 0.934 at fir W=2, 0.952 at fir W=4, 0.963 and 0.970 at records --
 * and still cost 1.158 to 1.304 in paired wall at W=8 on three of the four
 * kernels. So a long idle window is right when the pool is not oversubscribed
 * and wrong when it is, which is the rule below: lanes at pool start against
 * the CPUs this process may run on
 * (research/investigations/compute-runtime/RESULTS.md, run 34631106340 with
 * the A/B control -DWF_PAR_SPIN_ROUNDS=1000000000, and run 34632558439 with
 * the A/B control -DWF_PAR_SPIN_ROUNDS=16384; the per-call series that the
 * placement evidence is read off are in each run's raw.tsv).
 *
 * 1,000 us is not a swept value and nothing here selects it. It is two orders
 * of magnitude above the park-and-wake this file's own probe measures and an
 * order of magnitude below the tens of milliseconds the hosted per-call series
 * takes to settle, so it is long enough to cover a wake and short enough that
 * a lane no longer needed stops burning a CPU within a millisecond. The guard
 * is what lets the compute scoreboard build its A/B twin at another value
 * through WF_RUNTIME_CONTROL_FLAGS and measure it against the shipped runtime
 * inside one set of passes.
 *
 * The rule was then measured as shipped, against a control built at
 * WF_PAR_IDLE_WINDOW_US=0 on the same SMT runner class (run 34638747514,
 * whose machine is a slow one of that class -- mandelbrot W=4 reads 5,676 us
 * on oneTBB). Read as control over windowed, so above 1.000 is the window
 * ahead: mandelbrot 1.005 / 1.007 / 0.986 at W=2/4/8, fir 1.000 / 1.006 /
 * 0.975 (five of five lower at W=8), quadrature 1.016 / 0.995 / 1.003,
 * records 1.014 / 0.955 / 1.029. Three things in that: the oversubscription
 * guard holds -- W=8 does not collapse the way the never-park twin did -- the
 * window buys half a percent to one and a half on mandelbrot and fir at the
 * fitted widths, and it is NOT free. The paired CPU column reads 0.972 and
 * 0.958 at mandelbrot W=2/W=4 and 0.977 and 0.956 at fir, so the window
 * spends three to four percent more process CPU than the control for that
 * wall, and records W=4 loses 4.5 percent of wall outright with the control
 * lower in four of five pairs.
 *
 * That cost is what the publish epoch below answers, and the reason is stated
 * beside it: a lane spinning out the window called wf__par_find every round,
 * and that reads two lines per other lane -- the lines a working lane writes
 * on every push and pop. Records is memory-bound and crosses 64 chunk
 * boundaries a call, which is why it pays most. An idle lane past the first
 * spin bound now reads one counter instead, and scans only when it moves.
 *
 * Each spin round also issues the hardware hint an SMT sibling needs from its
 * partner: wf_prim_spin_hint() is YieldProcessor() on Windows -- _mm_pause on
 * x86 and x64, a store barrier plus yield on arm -- and `pause` on x86 and
 * `yield` on aarch64 for the POSIX hosts too (prim.h); before that a POSIX
 * spin round emitted no pause at all, which is the tightest loop an SMT
 * sibling can be asked to share a core with. That hint is REASONED AND
 * UNMEASURED IN ISOLATION: no twin separates it from anything else, and the
 * hosted evidence above measured the window, not the hint. What stands behind
 * it is the structure of the host -- a lane spinning on one of these two-core,
 * four-CPU SMT runners shares a core with a sibling that needs the spinning
 * partner to release issue slots -- and the cost of being wrong is one
 * instruction a round. It landed with the window because that is the work that
 * put lanes in a spin loop for a millisecond at a time, not because a reading
 * selected it.
 *
 * The scheduler probes compile this file with WF_SCHED_TEST and hold native
 * threads at the park protocol's own race windows -- wf_sched_test_before_wait
 * fires from inside the sleep loop, and a coordinator thread waits on what it
 * publishes. Those probes assert the protocol, not this policy, and a window
 * would make when a lane arrives at that hook depend on a wall clock rather
 * than on a fixed number of misses. Under WF_SCHED_TEST the window is
 * therefore compile-time zero: the loops then take exactly the fixed bound
 * below, which is the arrival those hooks were written against. The epoch
 * shortcut needs no separate switch for the same reason -- it is gated on the
 * window having opened, so a zero window leaves every round a full scan and
 * the enumerating probes reach wf__par_find, wf__par_steal and their hooks on
 * exactly the rounds they always did.
 *
 * This selects how an already admitted program waits. It is not a timeout, a
 * fuel bound or a proof-work budget; no acceptance path reads it, it cannot
 * reject a program, and with the window at zero the loops behave as they did
 * before it existed. */

/* How many chunks an independent map may be split into, as a multiple of the

 * a MINIMUM, so this is a ceiling on chunk count and never a floor on chunk
 * size: a range too small to be worth splitting stays bounded by the work term
 * however much oversubscription this allows.
 *
 * What is known about 16, which arrived with the splitter: at the work unit
 * entry.c now carries, 150,000, it is the BINDING term for all three of the
 * compute scoreboard's map kernels at the widths a four- or eight-CPU host
 * records. The work term affords mandelbrot 143 chunks (weight 219 over 98,304
 * points), records 708 (weight 812 over 131,072 records) and fir 524 (weight
 * 150 over 524,288 outputs), so every one of them reads 32 chunks at two
 * lanes, 64 at four and 128 at eight: the cap, not the grain. Past that the
 * two large maps stay on the cap -- records and fir read 256 at sixteen lanes
 * and 512 at thirty-two -- while mandelbrot's work term binds again from
 * sixteen lanes up and holds it at 128. So for these sizes this cap IS the
 * grain at the recorded widths, and it is no longer slack anywhere below
 * sixteen lanes. (Until 2026-09-12 the work unit was 1,200,000, and the
 * division was the other way: records and fir were cap-bound at 32 and 64
 * while mandelbrot could afford only 17 chunks, so its 16 were the grain --
 * which is why the work unit's own sweep could not move the records or fir row
 * at either width. That remains a true statement about those runs
 * (research/investigations/compute-runtime/RESULTS.md, the split work unit
 * swept against the Mandelbrot grain).) Against any of these counts oneTBB's
 * auto_partitioner hands the same skewed mandelbrot map out as about 1,536
 * callbacks.
 *
 * What keeps the cap at 16 now that it is the binding term is the M1 Pro grain
 * twin of 2026-09-11, the run that moved the work unit
 * (research/investigations/compute-runtime/RESULTS.md, the M1 Pro grain twin;
 * its `wf-b` arm was built -DWF_PAR_SPLIT_WORK_UNIT=150000
 * -DWF_PAR_SPLIT_OVERSUBSCRIBE=32). That arm and the runtime now shipped agree
 * on mandelbrot at W=8: a cap of 32 per lane wants 256 chunks there and only
 * 143 are affordable, so both give 128, and the 0.692 [0.65-0.75] with five of
 * five pairs lower that the twin read at W=8 is what the work unit alone now
 * buys. Where they differ is W=4 -- 128 chunks against the 64 this cap allows
 * -- and that is the width the twin charged for: paired CPU 1.189 on
 * mandelbrot and 1.177 on fir to buy wall inside 1.5 percent either way (1.015
 * and 0.998), three to four percent of process CPU for nothing at the width a
 * four-CPU table records. The twin moved both terms at once, so those figures
 * price the finer grain as a whole rather than the cap alone; what stands
 * against 32 is that the only reading of a 32-per-lane build spends CPU at W=4
 * and returns nothing at W=8 that a 16-per-lane build does not already return,
 * while the hosted four-CPU twin that reached only the 64 chunks this cap
 * allows (run 34630112178) read neutral at W=4. So the cap stays at 16 and the
 * work unit is what moved.
 *
 * It was also swept directly, and that sweep selects nothing. The compute
 * scoreboard ran three candidate pairs against the shipped runtime through its
 * A/B twin -- the cap and the work unit raised together, so mandelbrot's chunk
 * count could pass its own cap rather than stop at it -- one
 * `compare PASSES=5 CALLS=5` each on the four-CPU Linux development host, the
 * plain image byte-identical in all three. The chunk counts moved exactly as
 * the rule predicts: (64, 300,000) gave mandelbrot 64 chunks at every width
 * with records and fir at 128/256/256, (256, 75,000) gave 256 with
 * 512/1024/1024, and (1024, 20,000) gave 1,024 with records 2048/4096/4096 and
 * fir 2,048 at every width. The acceptance was
 * mandelbrot's W=4 `wf-b/wf` wall below 1.000 with at least four of five
 * paired passes lower, no kernel reproducibly worse at W=2 or W=4, W=4 paired
 * CPU no worse than 1.05, and W=1 unchanged. It read 0.999 (3/5), 0.992 (3/5)
 * and 0.970 (5/5), and the third is not selectable, because QUADRATURE IS A
 * NULL ARM IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE RUNS -- it emits no split call at all, so its
 * two images do identical work -- and in that same third run quadrature's own
 * W=4 pair read 0.940 with five of five lower. Over the four runs quadrature's
 * identical-work W=4 pair spans 0.936 to 1.086, including both a 5/5-lower and
 * a 0/5-lower reading, which is the one thing a within-pass twin cannot remove:
 * the two images differ in bytes and therefore in code placement, this bundle's
 * largest confound. (1024, 20,000) also took fir's W=2 pair to 1.053 with one
 * of five lower. So nothing in THAT sweep selects a cap; what 16 stands on is
 * the grain twin's W=4 CPU column above, not these three pairs
 * (research/investigations/compute-runtime/RESULTS.md, the oversubscription
 * cap measured with the A/B twin). Reopen on a host whose null arm holds
 * inside one percent, or on an eight-CPU host where W=8 is the
 * recorded block -- at the oversubscribed W=8 here the middle candidate read
 * fir 0.909 with five of five lower and paired CPU 0.922.
 *
 * The guard is what lets the compute scoreboard build a runtime at another
 * value through its WF_RUNTIME_CONTROL_FLAGS and A/B twin, so the cap can be
 * swept against the shipped runtime inside one set of passes instead of edited
 * per run. This selects how finely an admitted program is actualized in

 * the instrument existed, and `cmp` on the object says so.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. At a sparse call cadence -- WFB_GAP_US=2000, the mode the
 * scoreboard's README describes -- the compiled form at four lanes on the
 * hosted two-core, four-CPU SMT runners runs 8 to 18 percent behind references
 * that also park their workers, while its process CPU per call equals that of
 * the reference whose helpers never sleep. Lane time is ABSENT rather than
 * spent: about three milliseconds of it per call. A twin whose idle window
 * covers the gap recovers the whole of it, so parking is the cause, but a
 * park-and-wake this file's own wake_probe measures in tens of microseconds
 * cannot by itself account for three milliseconds. This records what each lane
 * is actually doing at the head of a call so the difference can be read off
 * rather than guessed: for every call, per lane, the time from the head to the
 * lane's return from its condvar wait and to its first successful steal, the
 * CPU it parked on against the CPU it woke on, and how long it had been parked.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS WHERE IT IS ON. Every event is a fixed store into a per-lane
 * ring of WF_PAR_TRACE_RING entries: no allocation, no lock, no shared line
 * between lanes, and nothing on the spin path. PARK and WAKE sit on either
 * side of a native sleep that costs microseconds; STEAL_OK fires at most once
 * per lane per call, guarded by one byte; the two root events fire once per
 * call each. The clock read is wf_prim_monotonic_us, the same one the idle
 * window samples, and sched_getcpu is a vDSO read on Linux. The ring wraps, so
 * a long process keeps its most recent WF_PAR_TRACE_RING events per lane and
 * never grows; one bench process makes six calls, so wrapping does not arise
 * there.
 *
 * Only a lane's own thread writes that lane's ring, and the count is published

 *     last full scan began rather than after it.
 *   - Inside the window, past the first spin bound. Read the epoch; scan only
 *     when it differs from the value read before the previous scan.
 *
 * WHY THE EPOCH CANNOT BE MISSED. Say this lane read epoch v, scanned, and
 * found nothing, and some slot is stealable afterwards. For each victim the
 * scan either saw an empty deque or lost the claim CAS. If it saw empty and
 * the victim is not empty now, a push happened after that observation, and
 * the push's release bump therefore produced a value above v. If it lost the
 * CAS, the winner's CAS lay between this lane's SEQ_CST `top` read and its own
 * CAS -- both after the epoch read -- so the winner's bump also produced a
 * value above v. Either way the next acquire load differs from v and the lane
 * scans again, and because that load acquires what the bump released, the
 * rescan sees the ring cell and the `bottom` the push wrote. The counter only
 * ever increases, so no bump can be cancelled by another, and reading it
 * BEFORE the scan rather than after is what makes "scanned at v" mean "the
 * scan began no earlier than v was current". */
