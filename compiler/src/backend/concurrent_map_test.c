/* Tests the runtime's concurrent map (concurrent_map.c):
 *
 * - one thread's random operations against a plain reference, on a map
 *   created for one key so that it grows many times;
 * - threads whose updates must all reach the sum of the values;
 * - threads inserting and removing, whose counts must match what is left;
 * - recorded histories of threads on few keys, and on many keys while the
 *   table grows, checked key by key for linearizability, which is local to
 *   each object (Herlihy and Wing), by Wing and Gong's search with Lowe's
 *   memoization as Porcupine implements it; the checker is first shown to
 *   refuse a history that is not linearizable and to accept one that is;
 * - interleavings too rare for threads to meet, driven step by step through
 *   the map's own functions, which is why the test includes its source;
 * - a map of entries: one thread's random operations on byte-string keys of
 *   many lengths against a plain reference, through moves; threads counting
 *   on shared keys while another holds the whole map and finds every
 *   entry's sum equal to a total each statement adds to with its entry
 *   locked; threads removing and keeping a few keys, spread or all starting
 *   at one cell so that their claims race in one run, never holding one
 *   key in two statements or two cells; and a drain that hands out every
 *   present entry once;
 * - a keyed statement that waits out its patience and holds the whole map
 *   instead: from inside a claim it gives back, after a lost claim of an
 *   empty or a removed cell, a move or a lost lock it must retry, after a
 *   bounded number of statements on a key others keep locking, and with
 *   every statement doing so while the map moves, holds count and claims
 *   race; and statements over the whole map that hold it in the order they
 *   asked, each after the keyed statements the hold before it kept
 *   waiting.
 *
 * Prints the first failure and exits 1, or exits 0.
