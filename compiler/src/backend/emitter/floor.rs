/// entry itself, where it would also suppress the optimizer's hot/cold
/// splitting of the program's own failure arms.
///
/// Without the runtime there is no second stack to move to, so the honest
/// answer is to run the entry on the thread the host started: the program
/// still runs and still means the same thing, with the ceiling and the bare
