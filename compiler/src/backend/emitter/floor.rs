/// the host's limit, a guess, a second constant — would give the writer a

/// The call carries `noinline` so that a small enough program is not pasted
/// into this definition as well, leaving every module with a second copy of
/// the whole program for the sake of a definition that only exists to keep an
/// unlinked module runnable. The restriction belongs here rather than on the
/// entry itself, where it would also suppress the optimizer's hot/cold
/// splitting of the program's own failure arms.
///
/// Without the runtime there is no second stack to move to, so the honest

/// still runs and still means the same thing, with the ceiling and the bare
/// host signal it had before the floor existed.
