//! Actualization of the permission judgment's overlap groups.
//!
//! For a group of sibling calls the checker permitted to overlap, every member
//! but the last is *handed out*: a lane is acquired, the call's arguments are
//! stored into that lane's frame, and the call — outlined into an internal
//! thunk over the frame — is published to the lane. The remaining member then
//! runs inline on the calling thread, and each handed-out member is joined
//! immediately after it — before the group's values are read and before any
//! exit edge.
//!
//! By default both edges call the same monomorphized function on the same
//! arguments. The opt-in sequential-refusal experiment instead calls its
//! existing sequential clone at the join, when one exists and the callee cannot
//! suspend. The clone has the same ordinary ABI and operations, and merely
//! declines descendant compute permissions. The successful task is unchanged.
//! Nothing here consults a fact, a source proof statement, or a row; it
//! consumes the group the checker already judged.
//!
//! **Lane acquisition comes before the frame.** The frame belongs to the lane, not to
//! the calling function, and nothing about it is built until a lane has been
//! granted. An activation that is refused a lane executes a null test and its
//! own call without reserving a task frame on the caller's stack. This removes
//! that additional frame from each recursive activation; it does not guarantee
//! identical spills or recursion depth in parallel and sequential machine code.
//! The earlier shape — a frame in the calling
//! function's entry block — put a slot and its stores in *every* activation of
//! an eligible recursive function, which cost about four times the stack per
//! frame on a small one and turned a recursion that ran into a bare SIGSEGV.
//!
//! Handing a call to another thread does still cost the caller what a
//! parallel schedule costs: the lane handle is live across the inline member,
//! and the thunk is a second caller of the handed-out function whose arguments
//! come out of memory, so an interprocedural fact about those arguments —
//! a constant, say — does not survive into the `--par` build.
//!
//! **Two worlds, selected once.** What the paragraph above describes is a cost
//! of *overlapping*, and a program that asked for lanes and did not get them
//! should not pay it. So a `--par` module carries the lowering above and, for
//! every function on a path from the entry to a handed-out call, a second copy
//! that actualizes nothing — the sequential lowering, byte for byte, so that
//! every transform the default build gets fires on it. The bootstrap asks the
//! runtime once whether this run was asked for a pool, and enters one world or
//! the other. In the default policy neither calls into the other, so nothing
//! below that branch tests anything again. The experimental refusal policy
//! also permits the already-required null branch to enter a sequential clone.
//! [`sequential_clone_set`] explains the second copy, the default selection, and
//! why the set is exactly that closure.
//!
//! **Symbol reservation.** A source function is emitted as `wf_` followed by
//! its own IDENT, and [FORM-3] spells IDENT `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`, so no source
//! name can produce a symbol whose first character after `wf_` is an
//! underscore. Every symbol this module and the runtime introduce therefore
//! begins `wf__par_`: the prefix is unreachable from source, so a program that
//! declares `fn par_try_fork(...)` still compiles and links exactly as it did
//! before this module existed. That is a reserved namespace, not a name check
//! — nothing here inspects a source function's spelling.

/// A *per-task* demand signal would be a different thing
/// entirely, and was measured killing the scheduler it was meant to help: the

/// took the fine-grain oracle cell from 0.4905 s to 0.9254 s. Nothing here reads
/// a per-task signal. A recursive component's budget-carrying variant enters
