/* What the runtime remembers about one descriptor it produced.
 *
 * All that is left of the descriptor ledger the deleted bounded pool needed.
 * Two facts, and each has exactly one reader that cannot do without it:
 *
 *   the resource class, because the ring is offered only a descriptor this
 *   runtime opened as a regular file for reading, and a directory handle would
 *   otherwise pass the port's own "is it a disk file" test;
 *
 *   whether the completion port has already taken this handle, because
 *   `CreateIoCompletionPort` associates a handle exactly once and there is no
 *   host call that asks whether it already has.
 *
 * The generation, the shared and serial lease modes, the active-lease count,
 * the close ticket and the condition variable a close waited on are all gone
 * with the pool they protected: the record is the submitting frame's block,
 * the emitter joins every outstanding operation before any terminator, and a
 * close is itself a submitted operation the program orders against its reads
 * -- which is the same argument the POSIX bridge has always run on, with no
 * ledger at all (design section 7). */

/* Registers a descriptor this runtime produced.  Returns 0, or a Win32 error
 * for a descriptor with no native handle.
 *
 * This is all an open does about the port: it records the class and stops.
 * Nothing in this unit calls into the completion runtime, and the dependency
 * runs one way only -- the bridge reads this table, this table never reaches
 * the bridge -- because a program that submits nothing links this unit and the
