//! Actualization of a permitted counted loop [PAR-2 candidate]: the loop
//! becomes a recursive split of its own index range.
//!
//! # What is emitted
//!
//! For either a reduction
//! `let a = INIT; for @l (i in lo..hi) { … set a = a (+) e … }` or an
//! independently proved map `for @l (i in lo..hi) { set out[i] = e; }`, this
//! builds two synthesized functions and replaces the loop site with one
//! instruction:
//!
//! ```text
//! chunk(seed, lo, hi, captures…)   the loop itself; reduction seed/result is
//!                                  the accumulator, map seed/result is Unit
//! split(seed, lo, hi, captures…, budget)
//!                                  hi <= lo         -> seed
//!                                  budget 0 or thin -> chunk(seed, lo, hi, …)
//!                                  otherwise        -> reduction: split left
//!                                                      (+) split right
//!                                                   -> map: split both, join,
//!                                                      return Unit
//! ```
//!
//! and at the site, one call: `split(seed, lo, hi, captures…, allowance)` in
//! the overlapped world, `chunk(seed, lo, hi, captures…)` in the sequential
//! one. A reduction's incoming accumulator folds into the leftmost chunk
//! rather than being recombined afterwards, so the fold's leaf order is the
//! source's own. A map's Unit return is ignored; the join makes its captured
//! stores complete. In both forms the sequential world's call is the loop
//! exactly.
//!
//! # Why the leaf is the loop and never one iteration
//!
//! Splitting to width one is the shape a hand-written recursion has, and
//! emitting it from a loop is a pessimization no worker count recovers: it
//! costs the body the vectorization and unrolling the loop gave it, and pays
//! `2N-1` activations for `N` iterations. Measured against the plain loop on
//! this machine: 7.6x slower on a two-operation body, 3.6x on an
//! eight-operation one, at every worker count from zero to eight. Bottoming
//! out in the loop over a subrange keeps the body's own optimization inside
//! the chunk and measured 3.1x at ten lanes on the same probe.
//!
//! # Why the runtime chooses the grain
//!
//! Every admitted reduction combine is exactly associative on its type's
//! complete value set, so its value does not depend on the combination tree.
//! An independent map has no value to combine: its proof says distinct
//! iterations write disjoint elements, and the `Unit` result exists only to
//! carry the ordinary worker join. Those are the two reasons the *number* of
//! chunks may depend on the span, the lane count, and what this lane is already
//! doing — asked once per loop entry, never per iteration.
//!
//! [`assign_weights`] prices the emitted IR of the chunk and the functions it
//! calls. Available captured extents replace fixed inner-loop factors; unknown
//! work retains the static estimate. No program name or writer annotation
//! selects a price.
//!
//! # What declines, and loudly
//!
//! A lane frame is bounded ([`LANE_FRAME_BYTES`]), and a split whose frame exceeds
//! it would have every lane acquisition refused forever: the program would pay the
//! splitter's calls and never overlap anything. That is exactly the silent
//! sequentialization the ledger exists to prevent, so the frame is measured
//! here, at compile time, and a loop that does not fit declines with a line
//! naming the width. Every decline in [`Decline`] is reported the same way.
