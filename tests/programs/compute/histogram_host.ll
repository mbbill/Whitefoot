; Forward the input range reference and runtime dimensions, and unpack the
; owned result cell.
; The owned runtime-capacity result is a `Box<Array<T>>`, whose content
; [TYPE-9] stores "in exactly one heap object the `Box` value owns" and which
; [STOR-1] releases with "one compiler-derived free at the owner's scope exit
; [STOR-3]". That one object is thin: the pending amendment
; compiler/storage-representation makes `Box<Array<T>>` "one pointer to one
; block laid out `[len | cap | elements]`", with "an `Array`, whose `len` equals
; its `cap` [WIN-1], storing that one runtime number once". So the block behind
; the returned pointer is `[len | elements]`: the adapter reads the length out
; of its first word and takes the element base one 8-byte header word past it,
; every element type here being `u64`, `f64` or `u8`, none of which [OP-9]
; aligns past 8. The same pointer is handed back as the retained handle, which
; is the only value the release row accepts.
