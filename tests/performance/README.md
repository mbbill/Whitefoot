# Paired compiler performance regression

`.github/workflows/compute-regression.yml` owns this runner. It compares the
current compiler/runtime with the merge base on the same Linux host. Neither
`make check` nor ordinary correctness CI constructs a baseline or runs timing.
Their only performance-instrument check is `sh tests/performance/test-verdict.sh`,
which uses small synthetic tables and no compiler.

The five programs and independent complete-result oracles live in
`tests/programs/compute/`: Mandelbrot, UTF-8 records, FIR, adaptive quadrature
and stencil. `Makefile` compiles those current sources with each arm's compiler
and its own ordinary runtime, using the shared native construction rules.
Both arms must support the current ordinary entry ABI; no historical source
adapter or research-side baseline discovery is used. Build failure is missing
comparison evidence, never a passing performance result.

Each arm has five native images. Both arms first run their correctness matrices
at eligible widths. Five passes then rotate kernel/width order and alternate
the arm order. One process contributes an unrecorded warmup and five measured
calls. Fixture construction, reference answers, checking, final release,
printing and shutdown are outside timing; output construction and all joined
WF work are inside. Process CPU includes all threads. The reducer takes the
median of each process's five calls, then the median of the five paired
baseline/candidate ratios. It rejects missing or duplicate cells, arms,
passes and samples. Decisions use full precision, not displayed rounded text.

Only widths 1, 2 and 4 that fit the host's available CPU count participate.
Fewer than two available CPUs refuses the run. On a four-CPU host, a campaign
has 150 measured processes and 30 preceding correctness processes. A width is
adverse when its wall ratio is below 0.97 and the baseline is faster in at
least four of five pairs. Two adverse widths in one kernel fail; one is a
visible suspect. This can miss a real regression confined to one width.
CPU ratios below 0.90 are reported using the wall pair count and never fail.
These thresholds are a noise/detection tradeoff, not a universal guarantee.

Every hosted comparison first runs the identical candidate images as both
arms. This control must produce no failing kernel; otherwise the job fails
with inconclusive measurement evidence and does not run the compiler
comparison. A previous runner's qualification cannot validate a new host
invocation. Instrument or fixture changes additionally run an explicit
slowdown control, which repeats real WF work and intermediate checking/release
inside the candidate interval and must fail all five kernels. These controls
do not establish a statistical false-alarm rate or sensitivity to every small
regression. Failed controls retain their raw data; there is no automatic retry
or threshold adjustment. The identical-image control needs no third native
build.

`compare.sh BASELINE_IMAGES CANDIDATE_IMAGES FRESH_RESULTS` is the explicit
measurement entry. Each child has a 60-second deadline, and the workflow bounds
the campaign as a whole. `manifest.txt`, `raw.tsv`, `paired.tsv`, `verdict.txt`
and per-process logs are uploaded on success or failure. Keep these files only
while the maintained regression workflow consumes them; experimental framework
comparisons belong to explicitly requested research runs.
