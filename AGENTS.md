# Whitefoot — agent instructions

Whitefoot is a programming language designed as a harness for AI agents.
Accepted programs make memory corruption, data races, uninitialized reads,
silent overflow and every other unproved partial operation unrepresentable:
each partial operation is admitted only after machine proof of its domain,
with no writer-accessible unsafe escape or runtime trap. Acceptance uses no
SMT; automatic derivation is specification-fixed, deterministic and
terminating, and no timeout, machine speed, solver state or work budget
selects acceptance. Harder proofs arrive as explicit finite `use` steps inside
a local `invariant`, checked as written. Proofs are erased before lowering and
may authorize check removal, optimization and parallel independence without
adding runtime branches, locks, dependencies or scheduling edges.

## Project goal

The target is a serious research compiler: general enough to implement the
real language, clean enough to evolve, and capable of compiling nontrivial
programs so we can test semantics and performance ideas quickly. It is not an
untrusted-input service or a stable LLVM-scale product.

“Good enough” means a real compiler rather than a source-shaped demo: one
general implementation path, compiler-independent correctness tests where they
help, useful diagnostics, an executable backend, and real programs that expose
language and compiler weaknesses.

When priorities conflict, use this order:

1. reach the next meaningful end-to-end language or performance experiment;
2. preserve semantic correctness and required safety checks;
3. keep the implementation understandable and easy to change;
4. add only the evidence needed to trust the current result; and
5. defer robustness, infrastructure, and polish that no current experiment
   needs.

If work does not help compile a real program, test a language rule, measure a
compiler idea, or remove the immediate blocker to one of those outcomes, it is
probably not the next work.

## Authority and reading

The [workflow map](docs/workflow.md) shows the development loop, who decides
what, where each check runs, and every document's role.

The active specification `spec/kernel-spec.md`, including its normative worked
example, defines the language and toolchain judgments, and the conformance
results state what the compiler implements. `design/` holds the decisions with
their reasons and refused alternatives. `docs/constitution.md` owns purpose,
objectives, tradeoffs and conditional design principles; a concrete choice
needs its own grounds, not just a constitutional ancestor.

Work is not planned in a document up front: a selected direction gets
`research/investigations/<name>/` for its design, measurements and rejected
alternatives, and its surviving decision goes to the design tree. Read only
the material relevant to the task, and do not turn historical research into an
implied implementation requirement. Compiler behavior, tests, archived code
and design prose do not define the language.

A finished task is not evidence: a claim cites the specification, a
conformance case, a measured result under `research/experiments/`, a design
under `research/investigations/`, or a design-tree decision where the
[citation boundaries](docs/workflow.md#citation-boundaries) permit. `archive/`
is frozen historical evidence and rationale that is not written to, and its
retired per-batch record `archive/done/` is not cited. Process wording in any
historical artifact is superseded by the rules below. Words such as
*validation* or *ratification* in language and design artifacts describe
evidence, not a workflow step.

## How work proceeds

Follow the four occasions of [decision practice](docs/practice.md#decision-work),
which also defines the material-choice boundary and the affected-set procedure:

1. **Start or resume:** read the affected current owners; for a material
   choice, also the relevant constitutional aims and existing decision
   grounds. On resumption, verify the actual worktree and PR state.
2. **Choose:** state why a material choice fits its requirements and evidence;
   record a discriminating experiment's criterion before using it to choose.
3. **Update:** when a conclusion or its grounds change, update current guidance
   and material dependents in the same work. A design revision is an
   owner-ruled tree change or a pending amendment.
4. **Finish:** run the completion review (checks, one independent review,
   finding routing, publication), then hand off to the owner.

Routine fixes under unchanged design need no decision record. Record reasons
when choices settle, not by reconstructing them at task completion.

Use a PR as the owner's ongoing review surface from the start, as a Draft
until the design-tree workflow makes it ready. Push coherent progress to the
same branch and keep its description and actual validation results current;
publish the reviewed result before reporting completion and link it. Updating
a work-branch PR never authorizes a merge into `main`.

Before stopping work, explain the task's specification revisions in the
conversation: which rules changed, their before/after behavior, and why those
changes were selected. A version number or PR link does not replace this.

Recurring procedures are skills, loaded when a task matches: `design-tree`
(decisions, amendments, DCR), `spec-amendment`, `completion-review` and
`owner-handoff`. Codex reads them from `.agents/skills/`; Claude Code reads
`.claude/skills/`, whose entries link to the same directories.

## Branch and main boundary

These are the complete approval and merge rules:

1. Work-branch changes need no approval, including plans, repository layout,
   specifications, conformance evidence, gate wiring, code, tests, and
   documentation, except that new repository-root entries require owner
   approval, changes to the live design tree require the owner's ruling under
   the design-tree skill, and a review finding whose resolution would change a
   design decision, a specification rule or the agreed scope requires the
   owner's direction. Unapproved design choices remain amendments while
   implementation continues.
2. Every change merged into `main` requires owner approval of the exact
   revision to be merged.
3. The exact revision merged into `main` must pass all repository tests through
   the canonical `make check` entry point before the merge.
4. If the merge changes `spec/kernel-spec.md` or conformance evidence, the
   pull request states what changed and its selection ground, answered against
   the exact revision being merged. There is no separate ledger: the
   specification's bytes are its identity, the released archives are
   immutable, and git is the history.

- **Work branch** is any branch other than `main`; its work, including edits
  to a specification, conformance evidence or these rules, proceeds within
  rule 1's boundaries.
- **Exact revision** is the complete tree that will enter `main`. If that tree
  changes after approval or after its successful test run, rules 2 and 3 apply
  to the new revision.
- **All repository tests** is the root `make check` target: the compiler
  build, Rust type/lint checks, maintained compiler/runtime/program tests,
  specification and guidance checks, conformance structure and coverage, and
  the full native conformance adapter. Formatting and Rust API documentation
  are authoring commands, performance comparison has its own workflow, and
  research is never a gate dependency; the
  [test boundary](docs/practice.md#test-boundary) owns the details.
- **Conformance evidence** is `tests/conformance` case source and manifest
  content, its runner and adapter, gate-integrity tests, and any collection or
  invocation wiring that can change which cases run or how their results are
  read.

No other workflow step, such as a plan, record, audit, rebase method or commit
shape, is an approval or merge precondition.

## Specification and test integrity

- The active specification `spec/kernel-spec.md` is editable on a work branch;
  released `spec/kernel-spec-vN.md` archives are immutable, and
  `compiler/build.rs` derives the active identity from its bytes. An amendment
  lands as one change, the outgoing bytes archived and the title advanced
  (spec-amendment skill), and `make check` verifies both. There is no
  candidate state: a branch carrying an amendment is merge-ready when its gate
  is green. A spec/compiler discrepancy is a technical defect; implementation
  convenience never selects language behavior.
- State each normative fact once; use rule-ID cross-references elsewhere.
  Rule IDs have one definition and bracketed references resolve. Express
  conditions as total positive rules or table data, without exception clauses.
- Surface names label checked invariants. Do not borrow backend terms naming
  lowering consequences; borrow another language's convention only after
  comparing and recording semantic differences, and only when meanings match.
- When the spec changes, bring everything derived from it to the newest version
  in the same work: conformance cases and verdicts, the lexer/parser and
  generated syntax data, tests, and docs. Beyond the archive and title, this
  consistency is your responsibility and is deliberately not machine-enforced.
- Do not silently weaken derived material to make a check pass. Editing a
  conformance verdict, deleting a failing test, or regenerating evidence to go
  green is a governance breach even though no script blocks it. Add ordinary
  compiler tests freely.
- Never delete, disable, ignore, narrow, or unwire a test or check merely to
  make `make check` green. A deliberately retired test must leave an honest
  technical explanation in the same change.
- Compiler capability, an internal error, a timeout, or an unimplemented
  feature is not a source-language rejection and must not rewrite normative
  expectations.

## Repository structure and hygiene

The repository root and every established directory are a curated, closed set,
so that the active `spec/`, the `compiler/` and the guidance in `docs/` are
found first. Follow this by judgment and keep moving; it is a standing rule,
not a reason to pause on every file.

- Do not add a repository-root entry without owner approval. Put new material
  in the existing directory that owns its kind; if none fits, ask.
- Every new file, directory, script, or document earns its place before it is
  created: name the compiler capability or experiment it serves, its existing
  home, and the condition under which it is removed. A script ships wired to a
  caller, a gate target or an explicit one-shot deleted after use; a document
  ships into an existing home and is kept current or deleted. No bulk dumps.
- Prefer native tooling. Check the Rust compiler with `cargo test`,
  `cargo clippy` and the workspace `forbid(unsafe_code)` lint, never with a
  Python script that re-implements them or a script forked per spec version.
  Python belongs only to genuinely compiler-independent tooling, and a new
  script states why the native path cannot do the job.
- Supersede in place: when new material replaces old, update, merge, or delete
  the old in the same change. Frozen archives and useful dated evidence keep
  their history under their own rules.
- Keep important folders, such as `spec/`, `compiler/`, `tests/` and the
  research directories, as clean as the root. Do not undertake structural
  churn that no current work needs, and never relocate a load-bearing path
  merely for tidiness: paths are pinned by the spec, tests, oracle scripts and
  gates. Prefer a clear map, a good name and a stated purpose over relocation.
- No active source, build, test, or tool may depend on `archive/`.
- New and modified repository artifacts, identifiers, comments, diagnostics,
  fixtures, test names, and file names use English.

## Compiler rules

The compiler's implementation rules are its design decisions in
`design/compiler`, each with its reason. Before changing the compiler, read the
subtree you are changing and its ancestors; a decision the tree does not cover
is an amendment, never an edit to the tree. Apply the design-tree skill's
[structural-choice assessment](design/skill/SKILL.md#workflow) when choosing or
revising compiler code structure, including during implementation, and record
deferred defects and improvement opportunities, with their validation, in
`docs/todo.md`.

Automatic CI checks current correctness and performance regressions;
exploratory timing runs only when requested. Use the guarded verification
targets in README, or wrap other local heavy builds, suites and benchmarks
with `perl .github/run-check.pl <label> <command> ...`, including commands
from other worktrees. Inspect an existing owner's PID instead of starting
another heavy command. Separate build time from test/program execution,
investigate a stage that exceeds its observed cost, and preserve the full gate
before merge.

## Communication

Describe compiler and language work with precise, neutral technical wording.
Avoid unnecessary security or attack-oriented framing when the task is ordinary
correctness checking; name the concrete rule, failure, and expected behavior.
Retain necessary technical terms and report material risks accurately. Wording
must clarify the work, never conceal its purpose or bypass platform safeguards.

## Data safety

Preserve unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree. Never discard, overwrite,
or rewrite work outside the requested change boundary.
