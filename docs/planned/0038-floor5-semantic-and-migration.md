# 0038 — FLOOR-5 semantic path and corpus migration

This is a temporary live coordination record, not execution authority.

- **Status:** `PLANNED` (unclaimed)
- **Authority:** owner approval 2026-08-07 (`governance/APPROVALS.md`); the
  fixed delta `governance/spec-evolution/spelling-relief-candidate.md`
- **Owner / workspace:** unclaimed / filled at claim
- **Base revision:** filled at claim
- **Dependency:** 0036 (grammar path + pins green at 69 productions)

## Goal

The second half of FLOOR-5's atomic activation, split from 0036 on the
first executor's recommendation because the 69-production verifier green is
a real integration boundary:

1. Semantic path — TYPE-5 derivation replacing the deleted annotations,
   OP-2 operand-derived row selection, GIVE-1's derived delivery type
   (a contract inversion in check/control.rs's check_let and matches.rs,
   not a deletion), if_stmt/value_if checking into the existing checked
   Bool-match (see 0036's verified condition (a)), GRAM-6's three new
   rejections, FN-4's re-keyed discharge premise at calls.rs and
   catalog.rs.
2. Corpus migration — 1353 targ deletions, 1748 let annotations, 257 Bool
   matches to if/else with mandatory else-if flattening, ~384 infix
   respells; scripted in scratch, every file passing the branch compiler's
   parse and FORM-2 canonical audit; conformance in the same change with
   no verdict meaning changed.
3. The four conformance cases 0036's condition (b) requires
   (gram6-neg-bool-scrutinee-match, gram6-neg-empty-else,
   gram6-neg-unflattened-else-if, give1-neg-empty-delivery-set), each
   asserting both the cited rule and that the citation lands on the if
   construct.
4. Evidence: both gates exit 0 (direct codes), adapter comparison, and the
   owner REVIEW PACKET (diffstat, ten representative before/after excerpts
   covering every transform class, verdict-meaning statement).

The migrated corpus parse is the completeness oracle for the extended
grammar tables — the verifier triple is not.
