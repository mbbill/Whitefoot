# Defects and follow-up work

Known defects, capability gaps, unresolved costs, and improvement opportunities
found during design or implementation, including unverified ones. An unverified
opportunity is a validation task: state its expected benefit, uncertainty, and
criterion for deciding whether to pursue it. Entries do not select a design.
Remove an item when its implementation and checks land, or its validation
concludes with a recorded disposition; retain any selected follow-up work here.
Add an item at the end of the section that owns its topic, so parallel branches
rarely insert at the same place.

## Numeric conversions and value evidence

- **Validate matching operation origins across named call arguments.** With
  `let input = 257_u16; let reduced = cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(input);`, a guard
  `reduced == 1_u8` keeps the direct comparison and the fully expanded
  `cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(257_u16) == 1_u8` origin. An ordinary call passing
  `input` to a requirement about `cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(input)` has a different
  typed tree. Current ENT-3 grants no partial origin expansion; forwarding
  through a parameter or passing the matching literal avoids this boundary.
  Assess whether consistent call-side origin normalization would recover
  useful proofs without enumerating intermediate expansion combinations.
  Require matching aliases, replaced inputs, joins and bounded proof cost;
  any additional accepted route needs its own specification decision. Defer
  from the modular conversion operation, which adds no proof family; reopen
  when a real caller needs this named-value form.

- **Select a total float-to-integer conversion policy.** The
  [conversion study](../research/investigations/numeric-conversions/DESIGN.md#companion-operations-and-explicit-deferrals)
  identifies cumbersome total float-to-integer compositions; rounding into a
  float destination is now `cvt.nearest` [OP-6], which deliberately admits no
  integer destination. A saturating or rounding float-to-integer operation
  needs its own NaN, rounding-direction and saturation choice, including
  nonrepresentable i64 maxima, and `llvm.fptosi.sat` fixes only one of those
  choices. Defer because no concrete consumer has selected the complete
  surface; reopen for a program that converts computed floats to integers
  (pixel coordinates, quantization), and compare source and emitted/native
  behavior before choosing a spelling or claiming an improvement.

- **Validate float and domain evidence through saved Results.** Exact
  conversions extend integer value relations only. A checked result
  with a float endpoint does not transport a domain predicate for its old
  input or a float equality; callers can use the payload or branch on
  `.defined` when the predicate is needed. Extending ENT-5/FN-9 could remove
  repeated validation in a real consumer, but requires typed noninteger value
  identities and guarded goal transport beyond the current numeric context.
  Validate input replacement, copied/replaced Results, joins, loops and proof
  costs without combining independent guards. Defer until such a consumer
  demonstrates the need; remove when a selected evidence rule covers it.

- **Qualify broader proved-range transport to the backend.** The
  [bounded conversion control](../research/investigations/numeric-conversions/DESIGN.md#optimized-helpers)
  removes a residual check when its already-verified entry range is supplied
  as an LLVM assumption. Direct lowering under the bare conversion
  proof solves that conversion case without a general transport family.
  Broader transport may benefit operations outside that family, but needs a
  concrete consumer and a complete retained-evidence-to-target mapping, with
  ordinary value support, mutation and call boundaries preserved. Reopen when
  such a consumer retains measurable work despite checked facts; require a
  matched benefit and unchanged acceptance/behavior before choosing a family.
  Defer from the exact-conversion change, and remove after selection and
  qualification or a documented decision that the candidate brings no benefit.

- **Validate further sharing of dense Result evidence when larger consumers need it.**
  The [cost comparison](../research/investigations/result-proof-transport/DESIGN.md#selected-cost-result)
  still places 32 independent outcomes at about 62 ms and 32 joins at about
  265 ms, versus 22 and 26 ms before value-associated proof transport. A dense
  matrix remains per live value and every surviving context participates in a
  join. Sharing more unchanged ordinary cells may reduce this cost, but the
  benefit and representation complexity remain unmeasured. Require matched
  time/RSS improvement on a larger real consumer, identical acceptance and
  valid retained proofs, and candidate/fallback preservation through support
  kills and joins. Defer a broader storage change because numeric-core reuse
  meets the recorded real-program and scale targets; reopen when more live
  Results or wider storage support makes this cost material. The language
  extensions below remain a separate question.

## Checker precision and proof cost

- **A direct call result loses its struct invariant at a reference target.**
  For a `nocopy Pair` with private `left` and `right` fields and invariant
  `left == right`, let `make() -> Pair` return `Pair(1, 1)`. A helper
  `update(pair: &Pair)` with `writes(pair)` that executes
  `set pair^ = make(); return unit;` fails FN-9 at its return. Replacing that
  assignment by `let next = make(); set pair^ = move next;` passes, as does
  direct construction into `pair^`. These paired observations are recorded
  in the [Forest investigation](../research/investigations/unique-keys/DESIGN.md#observations-with-the-current-compiler).
  FN-9 and CALL-4 specify publication of result-field relations onto direct
  ordinary-set destinations after target kills. Trace and repair that
  publication for reference destinations; the exact implementation cause is
  not established. This is conservative rejection, not permission to use a
  false invariant. Reopen before borrowed Forest replacement relies on the
  route. Validate direct-set and let-then-set positives, false callee results,
  alias writes and stale destination facts under the existing rules.

- **A length guard on a match binder is not a fact inside a loop that
  writes through it.** Minimal witness: a function matches `held^` as
  `List(items: list)` and, in a `for` loop, pops from `list` under
  `if list^.inner.len > 0_u64`; `deque_pop_front` then refuses [FN-8] for want
  of `values^.inner.len > 0`, although the guard reads exactly that place
  just before the call. The same guard on a parameter discharges it, so firn's
  `pop_items` passes the binder to a helper, `pop_one`, that takes the list as
  a parameter. Find why the binder's place loses the guard fact across the loop's
  writes, likely the fact's place key naming the binder rather than the
  matched field, and add a conformance case that the fixed checker accepts.
  Reopen with the next program that needs the helper.

- **A widening conversion's operand is read as any affine side.**
  [ENT-2] admits `cvt::<S, D>(e)` as a relation term or comparison-origin
  operand only for e a term or constant. [FN-9] relation terms match that:
  `postcondition_relation_datum` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/ensures.rs`
  recurses to a datum. `goal_affine_side` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/goals.rs` instead reads the operand
  as any affine side. Source cannot reach the difference today, because a
  call argument is an atom [GRAM-5] (`cvt::<u32, u64>(x + 1_u32)` does not
  parse), so a written operand is already a term or constant; the recursion
  is sound in any case, since a widening conversion keeps the mathematical
  value. The owner chose on 2026-09-29 to leave it. Narrow the recursion to
  `goal_operand` or widen ENT-2, with a conformance case either way, when a
  change lets a non-term operand reach a conversion.

- **A module check's cost for a library interface still grows with the
  module's functions.** Reading `std::process`'s closure (the `std::io`,
  `std::text`, `std::fs` and `std::process` interfaces) costs a one-function
  module 71.5 million instructions and a 16-function module 121.5 million
  ([library-modules checker costs](../research/investigations/library-modules/DESIGN.md#the-checkers-per-function-costs-after-the-split)).
  The nominal passes no longer contribute: the layout recursion judgment now
  walks the nominal table only after it changed, and postcondition selector
  admission indexes signatures by path. The remaining 50 million
  instructions are resolution's table building and public-closure check
  (`build_tables`, `check_public_closure` in `compiler/src/resolution/engine/`,
  about 25 million), the entailment schedule of the function inventory
  (`analyze_function_inventory` in `compiler/src/semantic/check.rs`, about 11
  million), instantiation-cycle rejection (7 million) and concrete signature
  collection (6 million). Impact: every check of a module that names a
  library module, and every program returning `ExitStatus`, pays per
  function for declarations it does not use. Change: find in each the work
  repeated per function over every declaration or signature of the closure
  and key it by declaration instead. Validate with the same comparison: H16
  at most 1.1 times H1, verdicts unchanged. Reopen when check time limits an
  experiment.

- **Each check still re-parses the fixed prelude.** The earlier
  [library-modules measurements](../research/investigations/library-modules/DESIGN.md#measurements-of-the-implemented-split)
  found 97 percent of a one-function module's parsed bytes in the 24 prelude
  records (4,425 bytes against the module's 105). Arm selection now indexes
  rows by the first token's full membership, and terminal-set iteration visits
  set bits; the
  [matched macOS comparison](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#parser-row-lookup-cleanup)
  reduces a small check's paired median by 12.4 percent, but the prelude is
  still parsed per check. Impact: fixed repeated work in every module check
  and composition. Change: retain its parsing once per process, relocating
  source/token identities because prelude records follow writer records,
  and preserving explicit resource-ceiling accounting. The relocation's
  representation and benefit remain unmeasured. Validate unchanged verdicts,
  derivations, locations and diagnostics across different writer bundles and
  limits, with a matched checking-cost improvement over this indexed baseline.
  Defer the representation change from the row-lookup cleanup; reopen when
  check time limits an experiment.

- **Some ENT-3 sources read no measure operand.** S5/S6 copies, S1
  comparisons, S11 counted captures, every S7 operation row and a checked
  integer row's success payload read an operand the specification calls an
  admitted term or constant through one reader that includes the MSR-1
  measure terms, so `let r = x % src^.len;` establishes
  `r < src^.len`. Other flow readers of the same shape (subscript offset
  terms, S13 index captures, allocation lengths, range-formation operands,
  integer-domain operands, the `Ok` constructor's payload) are unverified;
  affine images already cover some of them. Repair with the same reader, and
  validate it with paired direct and let-bound cases for each source,
  including a write that kills the measure, requiring no other verdict change.
  Deferred from the counted-endpoint and operation-fact repairs, which changed
  only S11's and S7's reading; reopen with the next entailment change or when
  a program needs the direct form.

- **Joined reference proofs lose useful target-relative information.** A
  reference selecting either of two freshly empty Slots cannot establish the
  append precondition from both constructors' facts; captured disjoint ranges
  formed in separate branches also lose their branch-local endpoint images
  at the join. These safe examples are rejected under the current fixed proof
  routes, rather than demonstrating an implementation violation. The
  [bounded query experiment](../research/investigations/consistency-followups/DESIGN.md#reference-joins-and-bounded-proof-precision)
  supports substituting both operands for the same selected alternative, but
  does not yet establish a complete family: current target authority differs
  from the function-wide origin inventory; Boolean and integer-domain consumers
  need uniform normalization; failed-query term registration needs inertness
  evidence; and polynomial work in an explicit target set is not a bound in
  source size. Keep the current rules until those obligations are resolved and
  matching full-origin, stale-capture, query-order and growth controls pass.
  Branch-local range images additionally need target-presence and capture-
  generation information; a plain union of branch images is insufficient.

- **Distinguish resolved formal anchors from holder queries in proof consumers.**
  Some entailment support/overlap consumers pass an already resolved formal
  root back through `PlaceMap::resolve`, which also serves written reference
  holders. After a parameter rebind this can conservatively add its other
  observed targets. Audit these calls before changing their interpretation;
  use entry-anchor/rebound-holder pairs and overlapping controls to establish
  whether separating the APIs recovers useful precision without omitting an
  origin. No incorrect acceptance or measured benefit is established. Defer
  this consumer change to the joined-reference work above; reopen when that
  work establishes point-current target authority or a real proof needs it.

- **Expose a failed callee proof behind an unavailable summary.** The
  [partially concrete reserve probe](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#partially-concrete-reserve-diagnostic)
  reports INV-1 at `room` after `priority_queue_make_room<ProbeDue, ceiling>`.
  Adding the 32-byte allocation bound only to the caller still fails; literal
  `8192` admits. Read-only diagnosis identifies reserve's missing local OP-9
  bound under ENT-2, not a demonstrated publication defect. First validate
  the bound in both reserve and caller, propagated through intervening helpers,
  then require the intended OP-9 rejection one element above it. Improve the
  diagnostic to identify the failed callee obligation and unavailable summary
  without changing acceptance. The GrowVector module witness met the same
  report: a wrapper generic only over `ceiling` that returns
  `grow_vector_append::<u64, ceiling>`'s length is refused at its own
  postcondition (FN-9, identically by main's compiler), while the reserve
  instance it reaches carries the same unbounded OP-9 `grow` obligation; the
  conformance case `mod6-pos-grow-vector-boundary` therefore wraps with a
  wrapper generic over the element type as well. Its benefit and exact
  attribution remain unverified; defer this diagnostic work while the
  admitted generic standalone control serves the experiment, and reopen when
  improving call-proof reports.

- **Descendant references retain precision opportunities.** A write through a
  widened range can discard its previously established length facts, and
  independent cursors within one descendant cover cannot use suffix spelling
  alone to establish separation. The
  [cursor investigation](../research/investigations/wildcard-path/DESIGN.md)
  records these limits and the current checking-cost qualification. Preserving
  unaffected extent facts or proving a relation between independently selected
  targets could reduce repeated bound proofs and admit more range-edit programs;
  the benefit and a sound representation remain unverified. Defer this work
  because the maintained list/tree/cursor program needs neither extension.
  Reopen when a concrete program needs that precision. Validate the proposed
  gain with positive editing cases, ancestor/window/stale-capture negative
  controls and the investigation's checking-cost criterion; do not equate
  targets merely because their covers agree. Close this item when the gain is
  implemented and qualified or the measured tradeoff supports declining it.

- **Pair-scoped parallel proofs need scaling and coverage work.** The current
  PAR-1 planner constructs questions for every ordered source pair in a segment
  and retains range separation only for that pair's first-statement state;
  repeated visits meet with logical AND. A segment of n members has n(n-1)/2
  pairs, but that logical requirement does not mandate quadratic repeated
  proof work. General index mapping through the first member's `ensures` is
  still unavailable; missing evidence keeps sequential lowering. For windows
  this means every [WIN-2] part-relative separation is refused when a member
  before the later one writes that window's `len`, which also refuses a read
  of an old slot after an append; the mapping would recover it. A cheaper
  recovery needs no mapping: a place reached through a reference live at the
  first statement's entry is interpreted in that state, and the reference's
  validity gives `i < len` there, so WIN-2's single-state separation still
  holds. That recovers the one pair this rule newly denies in the maintained
  programs, `deque_push_back` against `let first_after_append =
  original_first^` at `tests/programs/containers/deque-program.wf:113`.
  The ledger's denial should also name the length change as its cause; it
  currently reports only the overlapping write and read. Investigate
  indexing and reuse without losing statement identity, captured endpoints,
  flow context or all-pairs composition. Close this item when larger segments
  have measured costs and the intended proof coverage, retaining guarded,
  nonadjacent and stale-capture negative controls.

- **Large entering proof contexts still have substantial checking cost.**
  In the [post-x1 comparison](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#post-x1-selection),
  256 independent inequality pairs with 256 uses still take a median 2.337 s;
  the same context with only three uses takes 0.264 s. Reusing the ordered
  affine index within a certificate removes repeated premise preparation,
  but complete matrix/index construction and long-target AUTO traversal
  remain. This is not certificate-length cost alone: a fixed three-pair
  context admits all 4096 uses in 377 ms. The 512-pair context was accepted
  in exploratory runs; these results establish neither linear total cost
  nor a universal cost for the full use ceiling.
  Preserve the complete [ENT-6]/[PRF-1] rules when investigating that cost.

- **Ordinary-fallback views still copy a fact state per materialization.**
  The [current comparison](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#post-x1-selection)
  checks `tests/programs/fixed_run_library.wf` in 134 ms and
  `tests/programs/wfgrep.wf` in 834 ms. In `materialize_closure_at` in
  [`semantic/entailment/state.rs`](../compiler/src/semantic/entailment/state.rs):
  whenever a selected proof depends on a postcondition call, it clones the
  state, removes the call-dependent candidates and closes that view again.
  A [query-only ordinary projection](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#ordinary-fallback-attribution-and-candidate)
  passed the transition checks but improved fixed-run only 1.03x and left
  wfgrep unchanged, so it was not retained. Revisit the representation when
  a current workload attributes a substantial share to this path. Kill-time
  edge insertion and derivation interning for recreated cells also remain.

- **Acyclic generic instantiation has no established practical bound.**
  D7's unchanged-argument cycle rule establishes termination while acyclic
  fan-out may still require exponentially many instances relative to written
  source. The owner deferred this question in D7, whereas the current language
  design rules out exponential checking work. The
  [behavior investigation](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/BEHAVIOR.md#shared-semantic-boundary-and-exact-deltas)
  records the accepted 1343-byte / 2047-instance witness, same-instance controls,
  stage measurements and unresolved correspondence finding. No budget, timeout, new
  source refusal, or measured asymptotic guarantee has been selected.
  Reopen when generic container/behavior composition makes instance count or
  checking cost material. Recheck the distinct-instance and repeated-instance
  controls on that composition, separating semantic checking, lowering and
  emitted-code size; faster duplicate lookup alone cannot close the bound.
  The broader admission or sharing question remains deferred to an explicit
  choice supported by those controls and a complexity argument.

- **Acceptance and check removal are trusted to the whole checker.** Every
  lowering authorization (a subscript without a check, an exact operation, a
  discharged call goal) is issued by the same entailment engine that decides
  acceptance, so the trusted base for "no unproved partial operation" is the
  full front end plus entailment. The
  [certificate packet](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/PACKET.md)
  (v0.26, before the x1 ownership redesign) selects a staged route: the engine
  records a positive derivation for every discharged obligation, and a small
  verifier over a trusted proof-flow extraction checks them and jointly issues
  the lowering capability, while rejections stay with the engine because a
  missing certificate does not prove non-derivability. The compiler keeps a
  derivation ledger; no verifier, extraction boundary or joint issuer exists.
  Re-derive the packet's Envelope B against the current specification, then
  prototype the verifier on `tests/programs/` and measure its size, proof size
  and added compile time; a corrupted or missing certificate must never
  authorize lowering. Close when a verifier jointly issues the capability, or
  when the packet's stop gates record why the unified engine remains.

- **Write kills do not submit their own OWN-7 separations.** An ENT-5 write
  kill decides an index or range step against a fact's support only from the
  separations already retained on the current edge, which are the EFF-5
  pairwise and REF-2 preservation questions the structural checker submitted,
  plus literal index inequality. OWN-7 makes two ranges disjoint whenever the
  current ProofContext proves one of its four orderings, so a length fact over
  `head^[0_u64]` with `head = &rows[0_u64..1_u64]` should survive a write
  through `rows[1_u64..3_u64]`, bound or formed at the call; today it dies and
  the dependent subscript is rejected, and binding offsets proved distinct
  only by a guard behave the same way. The effect is over-rejection, never an
  unsound acceptance. Submitting one bounded question per written/support step
  pair at each kill would admit these programs at a proof cost per fact per
  write; a literal-endpoint range shortcut beside the literal index one would
  cover constant ranges cheaply. Validate with the bound and inline spellings,
  stale-capture and joined-origin negative controls, and a measured
  checking-cost comparison. Reopen when a real program needs a fact to survive
  a provably disjoint write; close when kill-time separation is implemented and
  qualified or declined on measured cost.

- **Call-argument consumers resolve through the function-wide origin
  inventory.** The entailment flow (`argument_referents`), the permission
  judgments (`argument_places`) and the place map now read one exhaustive
  classification of how an expression names caller storage (`named_place` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/places.rs`), so a new argument form can no longer be
  missed by one consumer; dropping its range-formation arm fails five tests
  across kills, permission and loop permission. They still resolve that place
  through the function-wide origin inventory, and permission substitutes
  unknown values for a row's index and range positions, while the structural
  checker holds each actual's point-current paths and its exact substituted
  row. `design/compiler/checker-facts.md` records the inventory as an
  over-approximation, not point-current authority, so reading the checker's
  facts instead could narrow kills and widen permissions: an acceptance and
  actualization change, not a refactor. Measure how often the two
  resolutions differ at calls on the corpus, and what verdicts and
  permissions change, before proposing it; reopen when a consumer's precision
  blocks a program or an experiment, and close when that comparison is made
  and the owner rules on it.

- **Rules recognized by spelling or implemented twice.** The checker's
  operand-row table (`compiler/src/semantic/check/generics/operands.rs`)
  recognizes the OP-10, OP-11 and OP-14 rows by their prelude spelling, and
  an OP-14 record takes its rule from it; the backend recognizes OP-11's row
  by symbol spelling (`compiler/src/backend/emitter.rs`). Both hold only
  because TYPE-6 rejects a source declaration that collides with the
  prelude. CALL-6's consistency check keeps its own closure
  (`compiler/src/semantic/check/publication.rs`) beside the ENT-4 closure the
  specification names, and INV-1 affine formation and call-goal images are
  each formed in both the checker and the flow.
  Select by PRE-1 operation identity, route CALL-6 through an isolated
  ordinary query, and form each image once. Validate with identical verdicts
  and a prelude-spelled source declaration that still reaches neither path.
  Reopen when a prelude collision rule changes.

- **Most repairs outside the goal families have no pinned pair.**
  `compiler/diagnostic-repairs` pins every repair with its rejected source
  and a program for each alternative, and keeps the words in one module;
  `driver::pinned_repairs` covers goal and effect rejections as well as
  selected formation and ownership refusals, while many sites across the
  checker that print a fixed repair sentence have no pair. Among
  them are TYPE-2's "build it with a construction function [OP-13]" for a
  storage shape or a cell, OWN-1's "write `move p` for the affine place" and
  "use the copy place without `move`", TYPE-9's inline-shape repair, and
  EFF-5's "these two entries of the callee's row
  may reach overlapping places through one argument", whose pair v0.74
  accepts now that an index and a range can be proved apart: every pair of
  one argument's declared paths a call compares now has a position to
  prove, so only a joined argument naming two places still reaches it. Some cannot be carried out as written: TYPE-9's
  inline-shape fallback sentence offers a constant-capacity form for
  `Segments<T>`, which has none [TYPE-9]; its reachability is unverified.
  A direct `Segments<u64>` parameter instead reaches TYPE-9's type mismatch
  with no repair (`type9-neg-segments-parameter`), although the rule requires
  one. Audit the inline-placement rejection paths, offer only wrapping in a
  `Box` for segments, and pin each reachable repair when revisiting those
  diagnostics.
  PROV-6's partial-consume repair writes the
  placeholder `let N(f: a, ...) = move v;`. PROV-6's LinearValueNotConsumed
  offers that placeholder as its second route for every linear binding,
  although an opaque host handle such as `ReadFile` cannot be taken apart
  [TYPE-2], an enum is taken apart by an own-place `match` [OWN-13], and a
  value of an unbounded type parameter can only be moved whole; the
  [beyond-memory article](articles/beyond-memory.md) shows it for
  `ReadFile`. TYPE-11's TypeInvariantWritableField repair is unpinned too:
  a `public` field is written only in an interface record, which a
  single-source pair cannot hold, so pinning it needs a module-form pair;
  and FN-9's propagated-exit repair is pinned for a refuted relation only,
  its unproved sentence still unpinned.
  Pin each with a program per
  alternative, rewording those that fail, and move the sentences into
  `check/repairs.rs`; validate by the pair test. Found in the review of the
  opaque-struct repair; reopen with the next diagnostics change or when an
  agent follows an unpinned repair that fails.

- **A cell taken apart with no binder is repaired by removing the
  statement, even when its content is linear.** TYPE-2's repair for
  `let Box(..) = move cell;` is "remove this statement", and so is the
  repair for a binder over a place the checker cannot type as a cell. With
  a linear content the removal leaves the cell to PROV-6's
  LinearValueNotConsumed at scope exit, and with a binder its uses become
  unresolved. DIAG-1 holds, since the refused judgment succeeds and the
  later ones judge the program's own statements, but a repair that moves
  the content out (`let content = move cell.inner;`) or names
  `free_empty` for a runtime-capacity content would save a round. Validate
  with a pinned pair for each; reopen when an agent is seen needing that
  round.

- **Four design nodes keep wording that later changes moved past.**
  `language/ownership/copy-classification`'s second decision still says the
  prelude declares `Box`, `Slots`, `Ring` and the fourteen host handles
  `nocopy` or `nodrop`, although the host handles moved to the standard
  library's host modules (the specification's OWN-1 already says so).
  `language/system-interface/opaque-scalar-types` calls `exit_status` and
  `socket_address_v4` construction functions, the term
  `language/data-model/opaque-struct` now keeps for OP-13's rows, and
  opaque-struct's third decision still names "the separate system
  declaration domain the prelude is deliberately not" where the refused
  domain concerns the standard library's host declarations too.
  `compiler/diagnostic-repairs`' fourth decision places the pairs in the
  pinned-sentence corpus, which now lives in `driver::pinned_repairs`. Each
  needs an amendment and the owner's ruling; found in the second review of
  the opaque-struct repair; reopen with the next change to any of these
  nodes.

- **A field of a program's opaque struct cannot be read.** TYPE-2 says an
  opaque struct's fields obey the ordinary field, ownership and release
  rules, but the checker gives a source opaque struct the fieldless
  `CheckedNominalKind::Opaque` (`compiler/src/semantic/model.rs`), so
  `token.value` and `token^.value` on a parameter of a program's
  `opaque struct Token { value: u64; }` are rejected with TYPE-5. No value of
  such a struct is ever formed, so only functions no call can reach with a
  value are refused, and host handles have no fields. Give the kind its
  declared fields for reads, writes and moves out; validate with an accepted
  read, write and move out on such a parameter. Found in the review of the
  opaque-struct repair; reopen when a program has a reason to declare an
  opaque struct with fields, or with the next change to nominal kinds.

- **Attribute cold wfgrep compiler memory before changing its representation.**
  The [module-product qualification](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#final-current-main-qualification)
  observes compiler-only peak RSS of 364.61 MiB on matched main and 377.62 MiB
  on the candidate. Most of this footprint predates retained module products;
  its allocation sources and reducible share are unverified. Profile live
  allocations by checking phase, then require a same-source reduction with
  unchanged verdicts and LLVM before selecting a representation change.
  Defer from entry-edit latency work because these are cold-build observations
  without causal attribution. Reopen when larger inputs or concurrent
  compilation make the footprint limiting; remove after attribution and an
  implemented or explicitly declined response.
- **An instantiated goal spells a field-read range endpoint as `?`.** An
  FN-8 goal over a range an argument formed at the call renders an endpoint
  that is not a literal, const or binding as `?`, as in
  `text^[?..?].len <= 16_u64` for `&text^[span.start..span.end]`, because the
  entailment renderer has no source text for such a capture. The repair
  already spells those endpoints from their source occurrence and says to
  copy them into bindings; the `instantiated_goal` payload does not. Spell
  the capture's source occurrence there too, through the same occurrence the
  repair reads, and pin it with the field-endpoint pair in
  `driver::pinned_repairs`. Reopen with the next change to goal rendering.
- **An affine bound is lost at a statement join where the binding's images
  differ.** After a scan whose `pos <= length` is known only as an affine
  invariant conclusion, `let result = pos; if result < start { set result = start; }`
  cannot prove `result <= length`, although each edge satisfies it: the
  then edge holds it in L0, the false edge only as an affine theorem, the L0
  join drops it and [ENT-6] gives `result` a fresh atom. No local invariant
  carries it, because the two edges' conclusions are different canonical
  inequalities. The
  [witness](../research/investigations/writer-lost-facts/DESIGN.md#shape-6-lockstep-arrays-and-struct-fields)
  is the limit PR #169 records for lockstep counters. Impact: writers keep
  both clamps or must add a header relation that makes the branch dead.
  Candidate: at a join input, project a two-atom affine conclusion over two
  live bindings' current images into L0 before the join; validate soundness
  against replacement and alias controls and measure closure cost first.
  Reopen when a consumer cannot avoid the branch.
- **A struct-field operand of a product or subtraction is not proved.** [ENT-6]
  gives affine value images to live own integer bindings and measures only,
  and its interval product needs both operands' images, so after
  `propagate parse_header(...)` publishes `header.width <= 16384_u32` and
  `header.height <= 16384_u32`, `let stride = header.width * 4_u32;` is
  proved but `stride * header.height` is not, and neither is a product whose
  operand was computed from a field; copying the fields into bindings first
  proves both. The same holds for a parameter's fields bounded by `requires`,
  so it predates v0.80, but v0.80's field relations make it the next thing a
  writer meets: PR #169's probe p2a predicted exit 24 and is refused at that
  product. A subtraction shows the same pattern: with
  `struct Span { start: u64; end: u64; }`, `span.end - span.start` stays
  [OP-2] Unproved (residual `span.end -defined span.start`) under
  `requires span.start <= span.end` on a by-value parameter, at 290b575b and
  f5024250, and at f5024250 also under that requirement on a `&Span`
  parameter, inside `if span.start <= span.end` on a local, and under the
  v0.82 struct invariant `span.start <= span.end` on a by-value parameter;
  copying the fields into bindings first proves each. [ENT-2] clause (a)
  makes the field places terms; where the subtraction's proof loses them is
  not yet located. Impact: one `let` per field before a nonlinear product
  or such a subtraction, and a struct invariant alone does not discharge a
  subtraction of the fields it orders. Candidate: give a tracked field place
  the current-value image its binding copy would have, killed with the
  field; validate against field writes, whole-value replacement and aliases,
  and measure closure cost; check that it also discharges the subtraction.
  Reopen when a program cannot copy the field, or with the next change to
  struct invariants.

- **An opaque struct's capabilities ignore its fields.** The checker gives
  every opaque struct a module declares the field-less host representation
  (`CheckedNominalKind::Opaque`), whose capabilities come from its modifiers
  alone, while [TYPE-2] and [PROV-6] give an opaque struct the capabilities
  its fields give it: `opaque struct Holder { item: Box<u8>; }` without a
  modifier is copy to the checker and affine to the specification. No such
  struct has a value [TYPE-2], so the gap shows only in a generic bound or a
  second use checked against a declared type, and `Instant`, the one opaque
  struct with a field, has a copy field and no modifier, where the two agree.
  Its layout is also the 32-byte host representation rather than its fields'.
  Give an opaque struct with fields the ordinary struct kind with a refused
  constructor. The same representation cites the wrong rule for `Instant`'s
  field: `instant.ticks` is rejected as TYPE-5, "expected a source struct",
  where [TYPE-2] makes the field private to a module with no implementation
  record [MOD-6], and destructuring an `Instant` reaches a repair sentence
  no conformance case covers. Validate with conformance cases that pass such
  a struct where `T: copy` is required and use it twice, both rejected, that
  read `instant.ticks` and are rejected citing MOD-6, and that destructure an
  `Instant` and are rejected citing TYPE-2 with its repair, with `Instant`
  otherwise unchanged. Reopen with the next change to opaque structs or
  `std::time`.

- **The container inventory's comments predate Segments.**
  `compiler/src/resolution/kernel.rs` describes `ContainerShape` as three
  storage shapes and a cell and `ContainerNominal::shape` as one of four,
  although the enum includes `Segments`; `DeclarationMeta::container` in
  `compiler/src/resolution/engine.rs` repeats the four-shape inventory.
  This misstates the inventory for a
  reader adding a consumer. Update those descriptions when the nominal
  inventory is next edited; the storage-destructuring repair uses its actual
  identities and needs no inventory change.

## Containers and storage lowering

- **A hash map offers no sample or bounded visit.**
  `std::collections::hash_map` visits every pair (`hash_map_each`) and
  nothing less, so a program that must look at a few pairs at a time, as
  Redis samples keys with an expiry, either scans the whole map inside one
  atomic statement, holding every other context for the scan, or keeps a
  second structure beside it: the Redis subset keeps a priority queue of
  expiries, one entry per expiry set, including those a later command
  replaced (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`,
  Experiment 8). A visit that starts at a position and returns the position
  the next visit resumes at would express sampling and incremental scans,
  as Redis's `SCAN`. Validate with a `SCAN`-style program over a map that
  changes between visits, every pair present throughout reported at least
  once. Reopen when a program must walk a shared map without holding it for
  the whole walk.

- **A hash map that removes and inserts at its ceiling fills with vacated
  buckets.** `hash_map_put` never rebuilds a map already at its ceiling
  (`language/data-model/hash-map-storage`), so a map that churns there, a
  bounded cache that evicts one key to admit another, keeps every bucket a
  removal vacated until the program calls `hash_map_rehash`; once no bucket is
  left vacant, every lookup of an absent key and every insertion probes the
  whole backing. Rebuilding at the same capacity when few buckets are filled,
  as below the ceiling, would clear them only for a map with fewer than three
  eighths of its buckets filled and would allocate a second backing at the
  ceiling; an in-place rehash that permutes the backing, the rebuild the node
  refuses as the default, clears them without one. Measure a map held at its
  ceiling under steady removal and insertion, probes per lookup of an absent
  key over time, with and without an automatic rehash, before choosing. Reopen
  with a program whose map churns at its ceiling.

- **Validate a shared Ring wrap calculation independent of layout bounds.**
  The corrected front predecessor handles every admitted capacity. Remaining
  address-only modular additions are justified by the positive-stride target
  bound or the zero-stride address operand; head advancement separately uses
  the safe offset one. An overflow-free common formulation could simplify
  those grounds across indexed access, shifts, transfers and cleanup, at the
  cost of more emitted arithmetic. Compare exact coordinates at u64 boundaries
  and representative native cost before selecting it. No remaining observable
  defect is established; defer beyond the predecessor repair and reopen when
  changing Ring layout or coordinate consumers.

- **Ordered Vector consumption still relocates rear elements.** The take-first
  composition exchanges an owned local with each first-half suffix slot, then
  consumes the reversed remainder. It preserves the prefix and callback order
  with O(removed) work and constant auxiliary storage, but still relocates
  `floor(removed / 2)` rear elements beyond a direct consumer's handoffs. The
  [matched native comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md)
  separates that source cost from redundant compiler snapshots; qualified
  independent stack slots and descriptor-before-transfer takes remove the
  latter in the local Clang 21 retained-record witness. That result establishes
  neither a guarantee across optimizers nor universal native parity. Keep the
  current ordinary composition while measuring any
  concrete workload that makes its remaining movement significant; introducing
  a more general operation without that evidence is deferred. Reopen before
  relying on ordered consumption in a performance-critical container. Compare
  an alternative under the same original-order, disjoint-callback,
  nodrop-ownership, constant-auxiliary-space and O(removed) contract, including
  nearly complete retention; require an attributable measured improvement
  against direct C and the current WF implementation. No new language operation
  is selected yet.

- **Deque scalar costs remain after payload-address qualification.** The
  [paired comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  isolates the qualified index fact and reduces normal scalar forward churn
  from about 2.3x C to 1.20–1.26x, leaving that residual gap unattributed.
  Retained scalar reverse churn is about seven percent slower in the new
  production layout despite identical relevant instructions and dependencies.
  A controlled 32-byte padding experiment restores the endpoint addresses
  without reliably removing the difference, so neither endpoint placement
  nor an intrinsic assumption cost is established as its cause. The owner
  selected provisional retention of the fact with both results preserved;
  no measured application mix makes the forward gain cancel the reverse loss.
  Compare the remaining scalar work with the same source, independent oracle
  and C controls, preserving native code/data placement and recording
  execution-state variation before attributing a cost to the interface or
  choosing a production alignment policy. Require repeatable improvement in
  both measurement orders and account for other affected paths. Defer broader
  tuning while this causal question is open; reopen for a workload dominated
  by retained reverse calls, a native-toolchain change or another material
  regression under the matched comparison.

- **Slab aggregate results retain extra transfers and layout overhead.**
  The [Slab comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/slab-library/RESULTS.md)
  separates the one-slot cell's extra word from its helper boundary: retained
  wide removal and consumption has three 256-byte transfers in WF versus one
  in C even though both `Option<Record>` results occupy 264 bytes. The separate
  insertion `Result<SlabHandle, Record>` occupied 280 bytes in WF's former
  product layout versus 264 in C's union ABI; the union layout of
  [compiler/payload-enum-layout](../design/compiler/payload-enum-layout.md)
  now makes it 264 bytes, as in C, and leaves `Option<Record>` and the
  transfer counts unchanged. Keep these distinctions when interpreting
  timing; a cell-layout change alone cannot remove these costs. Validate
  forwarding or result placement with
  the same owning return paths, failed insertion returning the offered owner,
  partial cleanup and alias controls, checking optimized transfers and
  same-source timings on supported toolchains. Defer call ABI
  changes until the forwarding experiment establishes which transfer can be
  removed without changing ownership; reopen with the owning-map library or
  a workload dominated by wide Slab removal.
  The [map's exhaustive returned-owner protocol](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  also supplies an ordinary enum alternative to reassess for Slab's extra
  cell word. Its fit and cost for stable slots, generation retirement,
  exhaustion and removal are unverified; compare that full Slab contract
  before replacing the maintained one-slot form. Defer that distinct
  consumer experiment rather than infer a Slab improvement from map timings.

- **PriorityQueue has distinct sift and return-boundary costs.** The
  [complete library comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md)
  measures retained scalar pop/push at 1.510--1.722 times same-algorithm C for
  16/256 elements. In that comparison WF returned push's Result through a
  pointer and cleared its inactive payload; C returns the scalar result in
  registers. The scalar cohort's three-leaf `Result<unit, u64>` now returns in
  registers too ([result-register investigation](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#selection)),
  while the inactive payload is still cleared and the wide cohort keeps its
  destination. The causal shares, and what that change recovered, are
  unmeasured. Normal wide replacement also costs 1.178--1.289 times
  the swap control at those sizes, while retained replacement reverses the
  direction. Separately, wide hole-sift C halves counted movement on large
  complete traces; ordinary WF swaps cannot be credited with that algorithm's
  cost. Validate return placement and initialization with unchanged-source
  compiler variants, the full owning/refusal chains, preserved C controls,
  both cohorts and emitted-code attribution. Investigate the wide replacement
  reversal before choosing an inlining or forwarding change. A general
  improvement must beat control variation without regressing the complete
  matrix; source ownership must remain intact. Defer ABI changes and a new
  storage operation until those discriminators establish their benefit and
  interference obligations; reopen for the indexed heap composition or an
  application dominated by these paths. Do not report universal native parity
  from the large scalar queue results.

- **Small results beyond the per-leaf register budget still use a
  destination.** A stored result returns in registers only when its scalar
  leaves fit the x86-64 budget of three integer-class words and two floating
  leaves ([result-register investigation](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#demotion-probe)).
  A 16-byte result with four 32-bit fields, a small byte array and the 32-byte
  opaque `ExitStatus` still pass through memory. So does every result with
  four to eight integer words, or three to eight floating leaves, on AArch64.
  Packing small integer leaves into shared words, or a per-target budget,
  could carry some of these. Either one adds per-target lowering to emitted
  code and to linked definitions. A third floating leaf on x86-64 cannot join
  them: it returns through the x87 stack, which is not bit-exact for signaling
  NaNs. Besides the launcher's `ExitStatus`, the maintained programs keep
  eight surviving calls with four-word results, in `prefix_expression.wf`,
  `owned_link_cursors.wf`, `option_slots.wf` and `containers/ordered.wf`,
  which an AArch64 budget would return in registers
  ([corpus](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#corpus)).
  None is on a measured path, and the benefit is unmeasured. Reopen when a
  maintained program keeps such a call on a measured path. Validate with
  unchanged source and both lowerings compiled. Require the destination
  round trip to disappear without a new demotion, a lost float bit pattern,
  or a regression in the program's timing, on each target that changes.

- **The hash-map `find` stays out of line because its probe loop is
  unrolled first.** In `tests/programs/containers/hashmap.wf`, LLVM fully
  unrolls `find`'s eight-slot probe loop while it optimizes `find` alone.
  When the inliner then reaches `map_trace`, `find` costs 580 against the
  `-O2` threshold of 225 (595 on main), so its seven calls stay out of line,
  as do the three `remove` calls
  ([lowering comparison](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#lowering)).
  In that investigation's rejected merged-returns lowering, the loop was not
  yet unrolled at that point. `find` cost 105 and `remove` 140, both were
  inlined and then peeled, and the hash-map trace ran at 0.601 of main's time
  against 0.956 for the selected lowering. Both lowerings return in
  registers, so the inlining separates them. How much of that gain an
  inlined, fully unrolled `find` keeps is unmeasured, as is whether other
  small container operations with fixed probe loops behave the same way.
  Candidate levers: loop metadata on the emitted probe loop that leaves it
  to the late unroll pass, after inlining; an unroll threshold or pass order
  in the pipeline the driver requests that runs full unrolling after the
  inliner; or an inline hint on small container operations, which alone
  raises the threshold only to 325. Each lever changes emitted code for every
  program. Validate on unchanged source against a criterion fixed before
  measuring: `find` and `remove` are inlined into `map_trace`, the
  20,000,000-repetition hash-map trace gains beyond run-to-run variation,
  `.text` across the maintained programs and container bundles stays within
  a stated growth bound, and the maintained paired compute comparison
  passes. Deferred because it is a host inlining-policy question separate
  from the result ABI, with one program as evidence. Reopen when a
  maintained workload's time is dominated by an out-of-line container
  lookup, or when the driver's optimization pipeline is revisited.

- **Indexed small-payload costs with retained boundaries need attribution.**
  The [native-cost record](../research/experiments/container-representation/indexed-library/RESULTS.md#remaining-native-costs)
  puts 4096-record growth/cleanup at 1.354--1.368 times swap C and
  1.392--1.408 times hole C across policies, cohorts and both series. The
  standalone/shared indexed executables are identical, so this is separate
  from the sharing choice. Wide mixed traces instead favor WF. The position
  reporter retains a 32-byte Due snapshot and a separate 16-byte handle
  snapshot in 48 stack bytes; its native frame is 80 bytes versus C's 32.
  Successful insertion also clears a 40-byte result before writing the active
  fields. Both implementations retain the same handle-validity checks; these
  observed snapshots and stores do not establish their elapsed-time shares.
  Validate which snapshots or result stores general compiler handling can
  avoid using unchanged source, matched public boundaries, emitted code,
  complete ownership/expiry oracles and unchanged controls. Preserve callback
  effects and all validity checks; add no container-specific compiler path.
  Defer optimization selection until that discriminator identifies a benefit;
  reopen for a consumer dominated by retained small-record growth or a measured
  toolchain change. No general interface, storage or compiler mechanism is
  selected by these ratios.

- **Short Vector cycles retain unresolved lowering costs.** The paired
  consumption experiment improves the large-record paths but slows the
  16-element scalar reuse chain in both source orders. Ordinary optimization
  also leaves a large WF/direct-C gap in the one-element suffix cycle, where
  neither composition relocates a rear element. Fewer aggregate transfers do
  not explain either cost. Keep this attribution separate from the operation
  choice above: compare the emitted loop, callback and argument code under
  ordinary and retained helpers, preserving the same source contract and
  accounting for the in-binary C controls' variation. A general lowering
  improvement is worthwhile if the short-cycle reduction is reproducible
  without losing the established large-record gain. Defer further tuning until
  that cause is established; reopen for a workload dominated by these cycles.
  The [paired samples and limits](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md)
  are the starting evidence, not a claim of uniform improvement.

- **Historical container comparisons need an explicit replay scope.** The
  current-library Slab, Vector, Deque, PriorityQueue and shared Indexed
  harnesses use the compiler's embedded `std::collections` records. The Map
  alternative-representation and Ordered insertion experiments, and Indexed's
  standalone-heap mode, still use retired syntax, flat library paths or pinned
  source overlays. Their dated results remain historical evidence; those
  modes are not current-compiler replay tools. Reopen only when a selected
  representation or insertion comparison needs them: port the complete
  source/overlay/identity path, preserve the original operation and retained
  call-boundary contracts, and run its independent correctness controls before
  new timing. Until then, use the recorded revision for historical replay;
  partial syntax edits would break its pinned source identities without
  establishing a usable current experiment.

- **Inactive-payload omission has measured optimizer regressions.** The
  destination-construction candidate removes the owning map's 264-byte vacant
  payload clear and its local pending-window clear while preserving active
  fields, descriptors, ownership and the ordinary ABI. The unchanged-source
  [comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#same-source-inactive-storage-lowering-comparison)
  and its reversed replay show wide growth and rehash gains, but normal wide
  replacement regresses by 7.5--9.0 percent after C normalization. Retained
  scalar Slab lookup also regresses. The registered selection criterion is
  not met; fewer stores are not grounds to accept these costs silently.
  In the replacement path, private exchange inlining adds stack temporaries
  and payload transfers; in Slab, a small result becomes separate field
  stores rather than one combined store. Their causal shares remain
  unisolated. The bounded poison-seeded aggregate-store follow-up also failed
  its structural screen: Slab's successful path grows from 23 to 28 native
  instructions, and wide Map put expands arrays into 105 LLVM loads. It was
  stopped before timings. The owner rejected both candidates; production
  retains baseline destination initialization. Reopening needs a distinct
  argument addressing those optimizer losses. Compare the same full matrices,
  null controls and ordinary/retained boundaries; preserve the dirty-storage,
  selected-variant, partial-window, linked-body and parallel cleanup checks.
  SSA construction and general aggregate forwarding are separate paths, not
  improvements established by this candidate.

- **Consumed aggregate locals can retain an argument snapshot.** An exposed
  mutable local is loaded into an immutable argument snapshot before a consuming
  call. Clang 21 forwards that snapshot in the large-record regression, while
  Apple Clang 15 retains an extra whole-record copy. General forwarding could
  remove that copy independently of the optimizer, but needs a liveness and
  interference argument across the complete argument list and result/input
  reuse. Existing call-result coalescing does not cover a consumer returning
  unit. Defer broadening that path while the frame and descriptor changes are
  qualified; reopen when the retained snapshot materially affects a measured
  workload. Require a before/after transfer and timing comparison plus the
  existing exposed-place, later-argument-write, reentered-block and owned-result
  snapshot controls. The
  [transfer evidence](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#v061-copy-and-consumption-trial)
  separates this opportunity from the library's remaining element relocation.

- **Ordered node construction and cleanup retain wide transfers.** The
  [ordered-map attribution](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#transfer-and-generated-code-attribution)
  shows field-expanded node-to-Box construction and a 504/4224-byte copy of
  each exhausted node before only its leading link is consumed. Reducing that
  work could improve split/build and final cleanup without changing the tree.
  Static transfer counts do not isolate its timing contribution. Validate a
  bounded construction/consumption improvement with unchanged ownership
  outcomes, node allocation counts, dirty/quarantined release checks and
  normal/retained scalar and wide comparisons; inspect optimized code to
  establish which transfers disappear. Keep aggregate-result ABI and general
  argument forwarding under the existing Slab and consumed-argument items;
  this task isolates fixed-node construction and consumed-field selection.
  As with the indexed snapshot/result work, validate general lowering rather
  than a container-specific compiler path. Defer a change until these
  construction/consumption paths isolate its benefit; reopen when the transfers
  materially affect a measured consumer or lowering work reaches those paths.

- **Box/window representation costs remain unqualified.** The current runtime-
  capacity Box is one pointer to one header-first allocation; `grow` uses
  allocation, memmove and free. A one-word owner, one allocation and header
  placement are distinct choices: a fat descriptor can also own one element
  allocation and make measure reads direct, while widening transport and
  capture storage. Neither alternative is established as generally faster.
  Keep the current implementation while separating owner width, measure loads,
  allocation count, copying and linked layout in representative single-thread
  and parallel comparisons. The successful bounded capture repair above is
  evidence about the synthesized task ABI; it neither attributes the earlier
  `records` failure nor proves that any one general layout choice caused it.
  Keep the deferred general representation study separate, and close this item
  only when the relevant costs and chosen tradeoffs have discriminating evidence.

- **Checking accepts a program whose build stops at target layout.** A
  program whose [OP-9] proof retains a count bound the selected target cannot
  hold passes `whitefootc --check` and `--check-module` and stops only when
  built, at [STOR-6] target qualification; the stop now names the call, the
  proved bound and the target's largest admitted count
  (`AllocationCountExceedsTarget`), but a writer who checks before building
  still learns of it one round late, which is what cost the Snowghost PNG
  decoder's writer most. The specification permits a check command to
  qualify the host target: [STOR-6] places target layout after semantic
  publication and makes its failure no source rejection [DIAG-1], which a
  check that also qualified the host and reported a `TargetLayout` stop
  (never a source verdict) would respect. But `driver::check` is
  defined as the source-verdict projection that stops before lowering, and
  `design/compiler` records no decision on what a check command covers. Two
  further obstacles: `--check-module` selects no entry, while target
  qualification qualifies the lowered program an entry reaches, so a
  module-level check has no materialization set to qualify; and qualifying
  requires lowering, whose cost on a check has not been measured. The
  options are qualifying the host in `--check` when an entry is selected,
  a separate target-check option, or relying on the OP-9 repair's warning
  that a bound near the language's limit stops at target layout. This is a
  compiler decision for the owner; validate a chosen form with the
  reproduction in `an_allocation_count_the_target_cannot_hold_is_located_with_its_bounds`
  (`compiler/src/driver/pinned_repairs.rs`) stopping at check time as a
  `TargetLayout` stop with no rule, and the check time of the corpus
  programs before and after. Reopen when the owner rules or another writer
  meets a build-only target stop.
- **A target stop inside a generic function names only the template's call.**
  The allocation-fit record captures the call and count coordinates once,
  from the checked template body (`allocation_fit_of_call` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions/calls/user.rs`), and lowering
  copies them into every monomorphized instance, so an
  `AllocationCountExceedsTarget` stop inside a generic function points at
  the template's allocation and not at the call that instantiated it, while
  a source rejection in a concrete instance names a requesting call
  [MOD-8]. Impact: a writer whose generic container helper is instantiated
  from several sites must find which instance carries the unbounded count.
  Change: carry the instantiating call's coordinate with each
  monomorphized instance's allocation record and print it as the
  requesting call. Validate with a generic allocating helper instantiated
  from two callers, one bounded and one not, whose stop names the unbounded
  caller. Deferred because no writer has met it; reopen when one does.

- **Union-laid-out enums: deferred refinements.**
  [compiler/payload-enum-layout](../design/compiler/payload-enum-layout.md)
  is implemented: enums with two or more payload variants whose product does
  not return in registers are unions of per-variant views and memory-only in
  the backend (`Component` 168 to 40 bytes, `IoError` 228 to 12, the I/O
  results 236--352 to 16--112; the
  [results](../research/investigations/enum-union-layout/DESIGN.md#implementation-results)).
  The investigation's timing criterion was met for the Slab and
  priority-queue comparisons; its I/O half was waived by the owner because
  the named I/O programs no longer compile. Deferred refinements, each to be
  measured on its own: a first-class
  word carrier so register-sized two-payload enums (at most 8 bytes saved in
  the maintained programs) could also shrink, reopened by a workload storing
  many of them; niche encoding, reopened with refined integer domains or a
  workload dominated by `Option<Box<T>>`; a narrower tag, reopened by a
  workload of enums whose views are less than 4-aligned; and an enum with one
  payload variant that holds a union enum (`ReadStop`, `Option<IoError>`)
  keeps the product form and is memory-only only because of that payload,
  which is correct but copies it by memmove where its other fields alone
  would be first-class, reopened if a measured path moves many of them.

- **A local `slots_new::<T, N>()` clears all N slots when it is created.**
  Snowghost's `match_complex` (`renderer/css/selectors/match.wf`) creates
  `slots_new::<Frame, 64>()`, 12-byte frames, on every call, and the code
  compiled at 290b575b clears the whole window first: its
  `proto_style_seq` driver calls `memset` for 0x308 bytes, 64 frames and
  the length word, at the function's start. In a callgrind profile of one
  style computation on the ECMAScript specification page (Snowghost
  58fa8ee's `proto_layout_seq`, collection limited to `compute_styles`),
  106 million calls made that `memset` 21 percent of the instructions
  (Snowghost `research/investigations/concurrency/DESIGN.md`, "Style's
  work per element"); Snowghost's rule index (ec21b7c) has since cut the
  calls, so the share is smaller now and not measured. [WIN-1] leaves every
  slot past `len` holding nothing and [OP-13] starts a `slots_new` window
  empty, and no access reads past `len`, so the clearing is not observable.
  Change: create an inline `Slots` window without clearing the slots past
  its length, checking first that no drop, move or bounds path in the
  lowering reads them, and measure a program that creates many
  short-lived windows. Not checked on a later revision. Reopen with the
  next change to `Slots` lowering or when a profile shows the clearing
  again.

## Parallel lowering and runtime

- **The concurrent map's writers wait a count of pauses, not a time.** A
  writer that finds its key locked waits 16 to 1,024 pauses
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`, `wait_for_cell`), about 0.2 to
  12 microseconds on the 4-CPU measuring host, where a pause took about
  12 ns; pause latency differs several times over between x86 cores, so
  the same counts wait longer elsewhere and the batching that won one-key
  `update` may cost latency instead. A keyed statement's patience, 2^16
  pauses before it holds the whole map, is a count of pauses too, 0.77 ms
  on that host. The change: bound the waits by elapsed time, read from the
  cycle counter, or let keyed statements park. Reopen when the 14900K
  measures one-key `update`, when waiting writers park, or when holds show
  in a workload's profile or tail latency. The 14900K has measured it
  ([the longest wait](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#the-longest-wait-for-a-held-cell)):
  no one count is best. One-key `update` with a block of a few nanoseconds
  rises with the count to 4,096 pauses and loses 12% to 43% at 64, while
  firn's `ZADD`, whose block takes about 0.8 µs, gains 10% at 64 pauses or
  fewer on four server CPUs. The change that follows from it: wait in
  proportion to how long the holder has held, which the holder would have
  to publish. Reopen when a workload's rate on one hot key is within that
  10% of its criterion.

- **The map's test has no gate run that checks memory.** A statement that
  locked a cell in a table a move had left read the cell's node after a
  statement in the next table had freed it; the result was always
  discarded, so no test's outcome differed, and only a build with
  `-fsanitize=address` saw it. `make -C compiler concurrent-map-test-sanitized`
  is that build, 7 s on the 14900K, and fails under the mutant that keeps
  the lock; it is not part of `completion-test`, whose runtime stage has
  run over its budget on macOS. The decision for the owner: raise the
  runtime budget and run it in the gate, or run it in a workflow of its
  own. Reopen with the next change to `concurrent_map.c`.

- **A driver thread's set of collected keys is never given back.**
  `wf_shared_map_keyed` (`compiler/src/backend/shared_map.c`) grows by
  doubling to the largest set of keys a statement on the thread has
  collected and keeps that block until the process ends, since drivers
  never leave. Reopen when drivers can be stopped, or when a program
  collects a set large enough to matter once.

- **A keyed statement on an absent key allocates a node it then frees.**
  `wf_cmap_lock_entry` (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`) claims a
  cell for an absent key, reusing the first removed cell its probe passed,
  and allocates the key's node so the block can write `Some`; a block that
  leaves the entry `None`, a `GET` that misses, frees the node again. Misses
  no longer grow the table or lengthen the next probe (one key missed in
  rounds of 400,000 answered `SPOP` at 159,680 to 177,699 a second), but each
  costs an allocation and a free from the user's free lists. The change:
  claim without a node and allocate it when the block first writes the slot,
  which needs the lowering to call the runtime there, or keep a freed node on
  the user for the next claim of the same size. Reopen when a profile of a
  miss-heavy workload shows the allocation.

- **A keyed statement that waits for its entry spins and does not park.**
  Its wait is bounded, since one out of patience holds the whole map
  ([bounded waits](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#bounded-waits)),
  but the driver it runs on spins instead of running its other contexts.
  Readers of one key no longer wait for each other
  ([shared reads](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#shared-reads-of-one-key):
  9.72 µs of server CPU per `LRANGE mylist 0 599` reply on two drivers
  against 8.76 µs on one, where exclusive holds spent 16.4 µs), but writers
  of one key still do: firn's `ZADD` spent 60% of its server CPU waiting
  for its one key on four server CPUs. The change: let a keyed statement
  that has not yet locked
  anything suspend like an object statement, with a mark for waiters (a bit
  of the hash or a word beside the cell, since the key word's second bit
  marks a pending claim) that the entry's unlock reads to wake it. Validate
  by `ZADD`'s server CPU per request on four drivers against one. Reopen
  with the work on `ZADD`'s rate.

- **`SharedMap<unit>` and maps of other payload-free values do not lower.**
  The unlock reads the entry's `Option` tag as an `i32`
  (`emit_shared_map_unlock` in `compiler/src/backend/emitter/shared.rs`) and
  refuses a tag-only enum, which `Option<unit>` may lower to, so a byte-keyed
  set fails with `InvalidIr` instead of compiling. The change: read the tag
  at the width the enum's layout gives. Reopen when a program needs a set of
  byte strings shared between contexts.

- **Entry nodes over 512 bytes come from the pool under its one lock.**
  `new_node` takes a large key's node from the context pool, whose free
  lists sit behind one spin lock (`wf_pool_take` in
  `compiler/src/backend/completion/bridge.c`), while smaller nodes come from
  per-user chunks. A workload of long keys from many drivers would contend
  on it. Reopen when a measured workload's keys exceed 512 bytes.

- **A keyed statement takes two dependent cache misses where firn's old
  keyspace took one.** `wf_cmap_lock_entry`
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`) loads the probed cell's key word
  and then the node it points to, both missing the cache under the suite's
  100,000 keys: under `INCR` at depth 16 on one server CPU it took 28.1% of
  firn's samples, 43% of them on the cell's load and 41% on the node's,
  while the old keyspace's bucket held the key and a short value together
  (`hash_map_edit`, 19.0%). On one server CPU firn answered `SET`, `GET` and
  `INCR` 8 to 12% below firn at `e92a54ed7`; on two the map's parallelism
  outweighs the miss. The change: keep a short entry's key bytes and slot in
  the cell's cache line, or start the probes of a pipeline's later requests
  before running the first. Reopen when a single-driver workload matters or
  the many-core run shows the misses limiting it
  (`research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md`, the suite).

- **Drivers park more often per request than Dragonfly's threads without
  pipelining.** At depth 1 on two server CPUs `redis-benchmark` is the limit
  (1.91 of its two CPUs, firn at 1.57 of its two); firn's threads slept 0.077
  times per `GET` against Dragonfly's 0.031, and the client spent 12.1% of
  its time waking the server in its send path against 7.1%, so the same
  client reached 2 to 7% fewer requests a second than against Dragonfly on
  11 of the suite's 19 tests, firn before the shared map alike. The change:
  let a driver spin for a bounded time before it parks in its completion
  wait, and measure what the spin costs an idle server. Reopen when depth-1
  rates on few cores become a goal, or with the next change to the
  completion wait.

- **`ZADD` is held near a million a second by one key's critical section.**
  firn answered 907,000 to 1,127,000 a second at every server CPU count on
  the 14900K, 0.88 of Dragonfly at 2 and 0.95 at 16
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)).
  For a member already held, `add_ranked` (`apps/firn/commands/sorted.wf`)
  copies the member twice, descends the order twice to remove and put it,
  and hashes it again to store the score, inside the one key's statement.
  The change: reuse the removed rank's member, store the score through the
  first lookup, and profile what remains. The same session's rerun of the
  branch with bounded waits (`9d1d5dfcd`, reported in PR #202's comments)
  answered `ZADD` about 10% lower at 4 and 8 server CPUs (1,011,000 against
  1,127,000 at 4, two of its three passes lower), so the profile should
  also say what a waiting statement's patience counting costs on one hot
  key. Validate by `ZADD` at depth 16 against Dragonfly at 2 and 16 server
  CPUs. Reopen with firn's next performance work.

- **A statement that holds a whole map takes turns by ticket.** A block
  that counts the map, names its state other than as an entry's target, or
  whose keys cannot be computed first holds the whole map, and such
  statements wait in line: firn's `MSET` answered 1,366,000 a second on
  four server CPUs before the ticketed holds and 587,000 after
  ([holding only the entries](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#holding-only-the-entries-a-statement-reaches)).
  firn's `MSET`, `DEL` and `EXISTS` now hold their keys' entries, so no
  measured workload waits there. The change, if one does: let the next in
  line wait without backing off. Reopen with a workload whose whole-map
  statements cannot hold their keys.

- **Nothing shows which statements hold their keys' entries.** A statement
  holding a map's state holds only its keys' entries when a twin of its
  block can compute them (`compiler/src/semantic/held_keys.rs`) and the
  program runs no block of two object statements; a change to the block, or
  one such block anywhere in the program, makes it hold the whole map with
  no diagnostic, and `MSET` then answers a fifth as much. The change: a
  ledger beside `--par-ledger` that lists each statement holding a map's
  state with how it is held and the condition that refused a twin, and a
  firn test that reads it. Reopen with the next statement whose hold
  matters to a measurement.

- **A read of an entry nobody else holds costs `GET` 3% to 4%.** A
  statement that only reads its entry counts itself in the cell's value
  word and reads the key word again, a second locked read-modify-write
  where an exclusive hold makes one, and with no other reader it gains
  nothing: firn's `GET` answered 2.6% lower than with exclusive holds on
  four server CPUs and 4.0% lower on one
  ([shared reads](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#shared-reads-of-one-key)).
  The change to measure: a reader that takes an unheld entry by the
  writer's one compare-and-swap, in a form later readers can still join.
  Reopen when `GET`'s rate is within 4% of a criterion.

- **A statement that holds its keys' entries locks each one exclusively.**
  A block that only reads its entries, firn's `EXISTS` of several keys,
  holds them alone, where a statement on one entry that only reads shares
  it. The change: lock a set's entries as readers when no entry statement
  in the block writes through its binder. Reopen when a workload's readers
  of several keys contend.

- **An object statement that only reads holds its object alone.** The
  checker classes a statement on an entry that writes nothing through its
  binder as a reader, and classes no statement on a `Shared<T>` object: the
  object runtime holds exclusively whatever the block does, so the class
  would decide nothing. The owner's principle of 2026-10-02 is that the
  language treats every atomic statement alike; the rule in the
  specification now does, and the checker's class and the object runtime's
  shared hold are the change. Reopen with a workload whose readers of one
  object contend.

- **firn spends more CPU per `SADD` and `HSET` than before the shared map
  on four drivers.** On the 14900K with 4 server CPUs both firn and firn at
  `e92a54ed7` kept every CPU busy, and firn answered 0.96 and 0.94 of the
  earlier firn, 6% more CPU per request, while it answered more of `LPUSH`
  and `RPOP` on the same single keys
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)).
  The cause is unattributed: the host had no `perf`. Validate by a profile
  of both on four drivers. Reopen with firn's next performance work.

- **Validate reuse of selected-target element layouts during emission.**
  [Zero-stride addressing](../compiler/src/target.rs) currently queries
  the ordinary layout calculator afresh for each element-address step. Repeated
  accesses to a deeply nested nominal element may recompute the same layout.
  Compare checking/emission cost on repeated nested-element accesses before
  introducing shared layout storage; require identical qualification and emitted
  addresses. The benefit and material cost are unmeasured, so keep the simple
  query for now and reopen when measuring target-emission cost or extending its
  layout consumers.

- **Parallel footprints omit ordinary result-list bindings.** The
  [sparse-routing trial](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#sparse-destination-routing-trial-2026-09-21)
  exposes a receiver map denied solely because one statement binds two local
  results. PAR-2 allows iteration-owned writes, but the current PAR-1/PAR-2
  walkers model one result definition per statement and refuse this form.
  A two-field record admits the same receiver map without added allocation or
  traversal; the retained form now qualifies useful helper discovery.
  Defer a general multi-definition footprint implementation; reopen when that
  workaround materially complicates a real consumer. Validate complete effects,
  consumption, exits and lowering for all result ordinals rather than granting
  a tuple-specific exception.

- **Initialized allocation can impose serial span on parallel work.** The
  [private-outbox representation](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#private-outboxes-without-frontier-compaction)
  requires a fresh C-by-D head matrix each level; its element fill is a
  sequential emitted loop before otherwise independent routing. Initialization
  remains linear work but can dominate the full critical path. The sparse
  oracle and useful helper work are now qualified, but the
  [FIFO comparison](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-phase-qualification-and-prospective-fifo-comparison-2026-09-22)
  stopped at its identical-image control. The end-to-end cost is not attributed.
  Measure fill/allocation separately from useful routing before choosing a
  general lowering change; preserve initial values,
  cleanup and the unchanged sequential image in any later experiment. Defer
  repair until a qualified cost comparison establishes materiality.

- **Loop capture selection remains conservative beyond forwarding.** The
  [needed-capture change](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#needed-loop-captures)
  retains every ordinary instruction and call argument. Removing an unused
  pure computation or an unused callee formal could shrink further frames,
  but needs independent effect and call-interface reasoning; no blocked
  consumer currently justifies that scope. Broader dead-computation or
  dead-formal analysis remains deferred: reopen
  when an otherwise useful map still exceeds the fixed frame bound, and
  validate smaller emitted frames on the same source without changing calls,
  cleanup or results before selecting that wider scope.

- **Pruning already-fitting loop frames needs a qualified benefit.** The
  [capture investigation](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#needed-loop-captures)
  now selects capture pruning only to rescue an originally oversized frame.
  Pruning fitting tasks changes transport and code placement without admitting
  a new loop, and records repeatedly reports an adverse W4 observation whose
  cause remains unresolved. Smaller frames could still help another consumer,
  but that benefit is unverified. Defer the broader optimization until a real
  fitting-frame consumer exposes a material transport cost; reopen with an
  unchanged-source comparison that retains native results, cleanup and a
  same-image null control, establishes its benefit and clears the protected
  records case before selecting the wider policy.

- **General DAG scheduling and competitiveness remain unqualified.** The
  [runtime-adjacency probe](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#runtime-adjacency-all-predecessor-probe)
  executes runtime-provided forward graphs with at most two predecessors and
  successors per vertex through ordinary WF source. Both owner mappings pass
  the original-edge oracle, including all such graphs through five vertices.
  Recursive owners overlap, but their joined rounds delay a ready task that
  the native readiness executor overlaps with another long task. The loop
  mapping retains zero split budget at the selected owner counts. Under
  topological numbering and contiguous ownership, rounds are bounded by C;
  routing adds O(C*C*R) work and two C*C head matrices. These results qualify
  the bounded expression, not arbitrary labeling/degree, general efficiency,
  elapsed competitiveness or physical peak workspace. Defer a general executor
  until a concrete consumer makes those remaining costs material. Reopen with
  its unchanged original graph, every result and exactly-once counts, charging
  sorting/remapping if needed, construction, initialization, routing, added
  precedences, wall/CPU and peak space against a useful native readiness
  executor. An owner-round limitation does not establish that every ordinary
  source formulation needs the same barrier.
  Separately, the bounded checked-call bridge recovered the selected A/D
  overlap while reducing observed C/D overlap across its fixed masks. The
  [amended identical-image control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#amended-cost-result-identical-image-control-failure)
  failed before any candidate comparison, so both the bridge and DONE-first
  runtime change are withdrawn for lack of cost qualification, not a measured
  implementation regression. Reopen only for a concrete call-group consumer
  and a bounded comparison with qualified measurement controls, unchanged
  results/edges and prospective wall/CPU protection for the other masks and W1.
  Recovered overlap alone selects neither implementation nor a broader executor.

- **Recursive frontier policy suppresses deep work on a spine with side leaves.**
  The [cutoff-attribution control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-qualification-and-cutoff-attribution)
  shows default W4 budget eight serializing task IDs 16 onward; the existing
  frontier-off mode restores deep overlap at lengths 16 and 32 on costly and
  last-heavy leaves. Preserving those offers may expose useful work, but its
  elapsed benefit, cheap/skew overhead and longer-spine space costs are unknown.
  Disabling the budget retains the runtime's 64 capture slots per lane, held
  until their enclosing joins. The stable-scatter result below also retains
  a 30–37 percent regression when that budget is disabled, so this observation
  does not select a global off policy. Defer policy changes until a concrete
  recursive consumer or a selected scheduling study makes the cutoff material.
  Reopen with unchanged task values, counts and edges; separate offered work
  from successful steals, account for live frames/slots, and qualify cheap,
  costly and skewed inputs across widths with prospective wall/CPU and W1
  criteria before adopting a replacement.

- **Parallel grain policy needs a dedicated study.** Captured extents are a
  provisional scheduling input, not an established broadly suitable policy.
  The [first same-source trial](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#runtime-extent-trial-result)
  improves prefix, histogram and stencil, but makes chain-pull 51 percent
  slower at two workers and incurs substantial CPU costs in some faster
  cases. Those measurements precede the continuation-accounting correction.
  The [frozen `6fdb6768` baseline](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#frozen-compute-baseline-2026-09-21)
  observes useful regular parallel work and substantial wide-stencil CPU cost;
  it does not isolate that correction's effect. Its scalar native controls do
  not establish optimized-native competitiveness. Study whether a robust common
  policy exists or workload, input shape, worker count and hardware require
  different choices, comparing wall time, CPU and scheduling/profile overhead.
  [Runtime profiles and PGO](ideas.md#parallel-grain-policies-and-runtime-profiles)
  are candidate inputs to that later study. The trial's failures remain
  evidence, not proof that no broadly useful strategy exists. Close this item
  when a policy meets explicit representative criteria or its accepted
  tradeoffs are recorded.
  The [first-index probe](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-expression-result)
  exposes a concrete input missing from current wave prices: data-dependent
  record lengths and early exit leave the same static estimate for one-byte
  and 65,536-byte records, and the small permitted waves receive no split
  budget. The [adjacent-helper result](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#adjacent-helper-pair-native-result)
  qualifies another source composition: the same two local-return blocks in
  ordinary calls execute nonempty absent/late-hit predicates on the caller
  and a helper, with observed overlapping lifetimes and preserved prefixes.
  The old counted form still has zero budget, and the cheap-first-hit case
  still pays for the other started block. A native two-block reference
  confirms the work contract, not pool competitiveness. At fixed offsets and
  descriptor lengths, payload-dependent early exit still changes actual work;
  bounds/read-only facts alone do not supply a representative price.
  Validate profitability on a representative costly search against a fair
  native reference, charging completed final-wave work, observer perturbation
  and scheduling/profile costs. The functional participation result selects
  no loaded-read, PGO or general grain policy.
  Defer further search pricing work until a concrete consumer requires it;
  reopen with that workload and a criterion that distinguishes useful overlap
  from merely higher worker participation. No lower threshold or new
  cancellation mechanism is selected by the expression result.

- **Array-helper pricing beyond original read-only references remains conservative.**
  The accepted [typed Box-array extent extension](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#read-only-box-array-helper-work-pricing)
  keeps static estimates for local owners, write-capable formals and references
  changed away from the original formal. Some unchanged forwarded references
  also lose the exact capture identity and fall back. Retaining those runtime extents could
  expose useful work, but their measured workload impact is unknown and a
  captured owner may already be consumed. Reopen when an affected helper's
  static price demonstrably withholds useful splitting and an existing checked
  validity fact or captured scalar measure can authorize the observation at
  every split site, including zero-trip loops. Defer broader transport until
  that case supplies both the benefit and the availability evidence; pricing
  must not infer a separate source lifetime.

- **Per-task loaded costs remain unavailable to loop work pricing.** The
  [phased spine](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#phased-spine-permission-and-work-price)
  has PAR-2 permission but emits the same static price 199 for cheap and costly
  leaves. At the current work unit, 754 iterations afford one chunk and 1,508
  first afford a positive split budget; all selected lengths through 32 remain
  unsplit, matching zero observed W4 overlap. Useful independent work may be
  withheld because a recurrence bound loaded inside a chunk is unavailable
  at its split site, even when the source input is read-only. Extent transport
  alone does not provide a representative task price for mixed loads. The
  [captured-scalar control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#captured-scalar-availability-control)
  transports the actual uniform leaf bound through the same helper chain:
  prices 48 and 655,398 retain sequential cheap/boundary controls and expose
  costly length-32 overlap on four W4 threads. All six cases pass at W1/W4
  in ordinary/traced images. This establishes scalar availability at the
  existing summary depth, but changes the input representation and derives no
  price for heterogeneous loads. Defer a general pricing change until a
  concrete variable-cost consumer supplies representative benefit criteria.
  Reopen with its unchanged IDs, values, exactly-once counts and original
  edges, preserving cheap/zero-trip controls and qualifying wall/CPU and W1
  overhead prospectively. Charge any added observation or aggregation reads,
  work and storage and establish validity at every split site; do not bypass
  the missing input with padding or manual grain. This is separate from
  read-only header extent transport and selects no pricing policy.

- **Zero-budget dispatch needs caller and placement attribution before adoption.** The
  [query-retained one-site control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#query-retained-control-result)
  meets its W4 criterion, but grows module text by 2,400 bytes and measures a
  2.97 percent W1 paired-median regression despite identical normalized W1
  instructions. It couples dispatch, pixel inlining and alias-check motion;
  it establishes neither standalone entry cost nor the benefit of applying
  the branch at every site. The general cdac candidate grows text by 3,920
  bytes (44.50 percent), including additional top-level inlining, with no new
  local timing. The subsequent
  [null-qualified Intel comparison](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#general-dispatch-reassessment)
  regresses records by 30.72 percent at W1 and 4.01 percent at W2. W1 never
  executes the added dispatch: its unchanged sequential chunk has different
  placement and a differently optimized caller. Neither cause is isolated.
  Withdraw the all-site optimization while retaining the existing query and
  splitter entry; a wrapper, noinline boundary or alignment policy needs its
  own grounds. Defer that broader optimizer/layout investigation behind the
  remaining compute-expression questions. Reopen with a comparable Intel host
  and a bounded control separating caller/stack changes from placement, with
  an identical-image control and full outputs, before selecting a general
  replacement. Require a demonstrated candidate benefit and qualification of
  the affected W1/parallel paths; a passing ARM or different-host run alone
  cannot clear the retained counterexample.

- **Stable scatter retains construction and packing costs.** The dated merged-model
  [joined-phase result](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#joined-phase-result-2026-09-21)
  identifies about 0.596 ms of chunk initialization and 0.569 ms of packing at
  W8, against a 1.930 ms ordinary mixed-input call. That image clears
  and copies a full inactive chunk payload per appended `None`, and expands
  aggregate transfers during input partitioning; borrowed tally/packing reads
  no longer retain that full-copy cost. These observations do not measure
  current main. A separate, unverified opportunity is to construct a single-use
  aggregate directly in its fresh placement destination, independently of
  whether inactive payload bytes are cleared. Feasibility across ordinary call
  boundaries and loop re-entry, and the whole-call benefit, remain unestablished.
  Defer this behind the current pricing, sparse-discovery and baseline work.
  Reopen when current optimized code reproduces material staging traffic;
  compare unchanged source, require that transfer to disappear, qualify whole-call
  wall/CPU results, and preserve enum/affine snapshots, alias behavior, window
  length updates and exact-once cleanup. The shared destination-initialization
  trial above was rejected; its initialized-value argument and measured
  tradeoffs do not establish which scatter paths benefit or their
  whole-call cost. Those source-specific observations remain unmeasured.
  A direct `Array` replacement is not admitted: `Chunk` contains `nocopy`
  slots and the fill constructor requires a copy element. Any alternative
  affine construction interface needs its own language/library grounds.
  Expanding the existing recursion frontier supplies no qualified win at 32;
  disabling it makes mixed input 30–37 percent slower at W2/W4/W8 despite more
  successful steals. Investigate packing span/batching or a balanced output
  representation while preserving stable order and machine-checked bounds.
  Short-phase CPU counter deltas and several small/skew controls remain
  unqualified, so they do not diagnose worker idleness. No general grain policy
  follows. Close this item only after the remaining construction and packing
  costs meet explicit work, space and performance criteria, or their tradeoffs
  are accepted.

- **The formal compute comparison has unresolved attribution and measurement costs.**
  The separate [amended DAG cost control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#amended-cost-result-identical-image-control-failure)
  completed all forty identical-image cells with correct results and adequate
  interval resolution, but two cells exceeded their fixed symmetric wall/CPU
  criteria. No candidate comparison ran. The variation is unattributed and
  supplies neither a compiler-regression verdict nor evidence of host noise;
  any later attribution needs its own bounded discriminator, not a favorable
  rerun or relaxed threshold. The
  [retained-data diagnosis](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#follow-up-diagnosis-of-retained-identical-image-variation)
  reproduces all reductions but finds a CPU delta exceeding the eight-CPU
  wall-interval capacity, substantial within-process CPU variation, and fixed
  per-family label order in the earlier BFS control. Establish short-interval
  CPU accounting separately from cumulative process totals before using those
  deltas to diagnose worker idleness. Per-thread activity, placement and
  competing-load observations are absent, so neither runtime work nor the
  wall-time variation is attributed. Preserve both stopped controls and defer
  scheduling or threshold changes. The completed
  [two-process baseline diagnostic](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#baseline-cpu-accounting-result-short-interval-attribution-failure)
  found no work-batch violation, but 25 of 65 W4 gap counter deltas exceeded
  physical capacity despite compatible enclosing and terminal CPU totals.
  Short-boundary attribution is therefore contradicted; it is no longer an
  unanswered validity question. The remaining measurement work is to establish
  accuracy at useful longer intervals and the selected comparison scale with
  independent accounting evidence before interpreting CPU cost. A compatible
  lifetime total does not supply that accuracy. No replacement clock is
  selected, no outcome clears the old null, and the separate wall-time
  variation remains unattributed. Reopen on a bounded discriminator for those
  remaining questions, preserving this result if it is uninformative.
  [Hosted observations](../research/investigations/test-economy/redesign.md#identical-image-host-control-failure)
  include an identical-image stencil control failing the unchanged three-percent
  band, and a separate actual records comparison failing at two widths while
  later runs retain a one-width suspect. A null failure supplies no compiler
  regression verdict, and a later pass does not explain an earlier failure.
  Attribute host/sample variability separately from emitted code, linked layout
  and runtime changes before changing a policy or declaring the suspect noise.
  The [PR 70 comparison at `7044db24`](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/35539977014)
  still fails for `records`: baseline/candidate wall-time ratios are 0.938915
  at two workers and 0.882544 at four, adverse in all five pairs at both
  widths; the other four kernels pass. Identical-image and intentional-slowdown
  qualification steps pass. The subsequent
  [bounded capture repair](../research/investigations/access-effects/parallel-array-captures.md)
  passed the unchanged formal comparison at every width: `records` ratios were
  1.087361, 1.004834 and 1.060012 at W1, W2 and W4, and all five kernels passed.
  Its identical-image control nevertheless retained a `records` W4 suspect at
  0.962815708 with four adverse pairs. The concrete PR 70 regression is repaired,
  while its cause and the earlier and remaining control variation are not
  attributed. The
  [result-register placement controls](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#hosted-compute-regression)
  show on a local Intel host that shifting records' two loop copies by 16 to
  48 bytes, with no executed instruction changed, moves main or that
  investigation's rejected merged-returns lowering by up to 18% and reverses
  their order at W2 and W4, while moving only the runtime does not. Its
  selected lowering's byte-identical records images read 1.073 at W1 on an
  EPYC 7763 and 0.855, a single-width suspect, on an EPYC 9V74. The
  [PR 78 hosted records inspection](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#records-w4-hosted-comparison-remains-unresolved)
  retains repeated W4 suspects at `30198a19` and `53c68c29`: the latter has
  wall/CPU ratios 0.898002/0.908317 with four adverse pairs, while its records
  null is not suspect. Exact x86 objects show unchanged hot work and runtime
  objects alongside reduced capture transport and changed linked placement;
  they establish no cause or fix. Existing raw data lacks scheduling counters,
  and ARM or emulated results cannot clear this Linux signal. A retained-image
  W4 paired/null counter check is a possible discriminator, not selected or
  run. Defer mechanism changes until evidence distinguishes the possible causes;
  reopen on selection of a bounded Linux attribution experiment and preserve
  the suspect if that experiment is uninformative. Keep this item
  until the observations and measurement/detection tradeoff are explained by
  discriminating evidence, rather than a later pass or changed threshold.

- **A `propagate` statement cannot be a [PAR-1] window member.** The rule
  admits only `let`-bound and scrutinee calls, so `let a = f(); let b =
  propagate g();` never overlaps. Allowing a `propagate` second member would
  need the lowering to join the hand-out before the `Err` return; a future
  investigation, taken up when a real program shows the gap.

- **Alias facts for worker-run loop chunks.** A synthesized loop-split chunk
  or splitter has no source signature, so its range and reference captures
  carry no `noalias`. The sequential world inlines the chunk into its source
  function, which has the facts; a chunk run as a worker lane does not, so a
  vectorizable chunk loop may keep a runtime overlap check. The facts would
  need their own derivation from PAR-2 independence and the enclosing call's
  EFF-5 result, since sibling chunks write other parts of the same captured
  range concurrently. Impact and whether any current kernel pays such a check
  are unmeasured. Validate by inspecting the optimized worker chunks of the
  formal compute kernels for `vector.memcheck` and, where one appears,
  comparing chunk time with and without a hand-added fact. Deferred because
  the range-reference change covers source signatures only; reopen when a
  measured parallel kernel shows the check.

- **Compute-bench private adapters still pass aggregate ranges.**
  `research/experiments/compute-bench/array_reference_host.ll`,
  `first_index_host.ll`, `dag_fanin_host.ll` and the first-index observation
  rewrite in that Makefile spell a range argument as one `{ ptr, i64 }`
  aggregate. The compiler now passes it as pointer and count; the machine code
  is identical on the admitted targets, but LLVM text bound into a WF module
  must use the split form, and the first-index rewrite no longer matches the
  emitted head and refuses. These dated research inputs were left unchanged;
  update them before running those experiments with a compiler that includes
  the split, keeping an older baseline arm on its own adapter.

- **A discarded affine result's call never joins a hand-out group.** Its
  expression statement runs the result's release immediately after the call,
  reading the value between a hand-out and its join, so
  `compiler/src/lowering/builder.rs` leaves that call unrecorded and it ends
  any overlap group through it, although PAR-1 permits it exactly as the
  let-bound call. It could instead be a group's last member, as an addressed
  binding already may. No measured
  program discards an affine result beside an independent call, so the
  benefit is unverified. Reopen when such a program appears; validate by
  emitting the call as the join site with its release after the join and
  comparing published bytes at several worker counts with the sequential
  lowering.

- **A rebound reference parameter's holder read overlaps every access
  through it.** PAR-1 reads a reference variable's own binding at each use,
  which the `let` that forms it or a `set` that rebinds it writes. A
  reference parameter's binding also stands for the place it names, so once
  a body rebinds the parameter (`set values = &values^[0_u64..8_u64];`),
  that holder read overlaps every write through `values` and denies pairs
  PAR-1 permits, such as a call writing one range of `values` beside a `let`
  that forms another. Giving the holder a place root of its own, which
  overlaps only itself, would separate the two. Validate with that pair
  permitted again and the rebinding still ordered against the uses after it.
  Found in the review of the holder-read fix; reopen when a program rebinds a
  reference parameter on a parallel path.

- **PAR-1 reads nothing for a range formed through a Box.** A `let` whose
  initializer forms a reference records no read of the place the reference
  starts from, so PAR-1 permits
  `let data = box_array_filled::<u64>(count: 2000000_u64, value: 0_u64);`
  beside `let all = &data.inner[0_u64..2000000_u64];`
  (`research/experiments/par-quicksort/quicksort.wf:73`) although forming the
  range loads the Box's pointer, which the first statement writes. No
  program observes it: the lowering hands out only calls, and a member that
  is not a call ends every overlap group (`overlaps` in
  `compiler/src/lowering/builder.rs`). Forming a reference to storage held
  in place needs only its address, so only a path through a Box's `inner`
  reads its owner. Record a read of the owner above each `inner` step a
  formed path passes; validate with that pair denied, the rest of the
  quicksort ledger unchanged, and `let larger = &v^[after..n];` still
  permitted beside `quicksort(v: smaller);`. Found while checking the
  parallelism article's ledger; reopen before the lowering admits a member
  that is not a call.

- **Parallel actualization is decided during translation.** A counted-loop
  split is chosen while its body is being lowered
  (`compiler/src/lowering/builder/split.rs`). The rescue mechanisms follow
  from that order: an oversized candidate's finished graph is transferred into
  its parent with every `IrFunction` field remapped by hand, ordinals are
  reserved late and the ledger rotates. Offer policy is spread over lowering,
  a call-grain post-pass, the emitter's lane-fit filter and the launcher, and
  the clone set is computed three times. Lowering the ordinary graph first and
  actualizing in one IR-to-IR pass whose plan the emitter only renders (the
  [architecture investigation](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p4-lowering-and-backend)'s P4.1) removes
  the transfer and lowering's use of the target layout. It replaces the
  graph-transfer decisions in
  `design/compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds.md`, so it needs a ruling.
  Validate with byte-identical LLVM for `tests/programs` and the `--par` test
  sources. Reopen when the next parallel-lowering experiment has to change the
  split.

- **A short context costs about 1.5 microseconds on several drivers.** With
  four drivers, a thousand batches of a thousand contexts that return at once
  took 1.47 seconds against 0.15 on one driver, and 0.92 and 1.35 at two
  and four drivers in Experiment 6
  (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, Experiments 5 and 6): idle drivers
  take half of the starter's queue, and the contexts, their arenas and the
  group count then move between cores for work of about 100 nanoseconds.
  A start joined by the next statement stays on one driver and costs what it
  does on one. A context that waits for the host amortizes this; one that
  computes briefly does not. Keeping a context on the starter's driver until
  it has run for a while, or stealing only from a queue longer than a
  threshold, would bound it. Reopen when a program starts many contexts that
  do little before they finish.

- **Only Linux with a ring runs several drivers.** With no kernel ring (the
  readiness route) and on Windows, every context still runs on the entry's
  thread: the readiness route's poll list and the completion port's wait are
  a single driver's. A second driver there needs a readiness registration per
  driver (`epoll` or `kqueue`) and, on Windows, a completion port per driver
  or one shared port whose completions carry their driver. Reopen when a
  server on either route needs more than one core.

- **A readiness wait and a helper's completion are found by scanning.** A
  record published on the thread that runs the contexts wakes its context by
  address, but one a helper thread publishes is found by a pass over every
  parked context, and with no ring every readiness wait is one `poll` over
  every waiting descriptor. Both are linear in the waiting contexts per wake.
  An `epoll` or `kqueue` registration, and a helper publication that queues
  its waiter, would make them proportional to the completions. Reopen when a
  many-context measurement on the helper or no-ring route attributes time to
  either pass.

- **Windows contexts run only on the completion port's route under test.**
  The Windows host job (`io-hosts.yml`) runs the two context cases of
  `compiler/tests/programs/network.rs`: twelve reverse-order peers each
  served in its own context with the completion port required, and two bound
  fetches on both routes. Without the port a Windows context's socket wait
  is a blocking helper wait, because that host has no readiness wait, so a
  server there holds a helper thread per silent peer, up to the adapter's 256
  helper records, past which it stops with a report. A `WSAPoll` readiness
  wait would give it the Linux readiness route's behavior. Reopen when a
  Windows server has to run without the port.

- **A wait on another context on a helper costs a thread.** Once contexts
  run, a stream write on every host, a stream read on every host but Linux
  with its ring, a connect on a host with no ring, and an accept on Windows
  run on helper threads, and the pool grows past its eight
  helpers while every helper is inside such a wait
  (`completion/file_adapter.c`, `wf_file_grow_for_peers_locked`). Each such
  wait in flight holds a thread, and a program with more than 256 at once
  stops with a report (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`,
  section 10.6). A readiness-driven adapter, one `poll`, `kqueue` or
  `WSAPoll` over every queued descriptor made where an idle thread already
  parks, would hold none for sockets; a standard stream shared with other
  processes would stay on helpers, since making it nonblocking would change it
  under them. Validate by a harness case of 257 socket waits running to
  completion on one thread and by the context echo server's rate on the
  no-ring route. Reopen when a program needs more than a few hundred such
  waits at once or a profile shows their threads.

- **The context echo server's rate at 1024 connections and with 64 KiB
  messages moved between sessions.** With R1 to R4 as committed,
  `tcp_contexts.wf` ran at 0.968 of the runtime before them at 1024
  connections (0.966 and 0.964 in two runs of 15 interleaved passes) and at
  1.047 with 64 KiB messages; with the stop check fixed, in a later session,
  it ran at 1.004 at 1024 connections (1.044 and 0.993) and at 0.971 with
  64 KiB messages, while 64 connections stayed within 1% in both sessions
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 10.5).
  Whether the progress changes cost anything at those workloads is open: the
  later session's two runs at 1024 connections differ by 5.1 points, more
  than the 3.6 points between the sessions, and the 64 KiB figure moved 7.6
  points the other way. Settle it by running the same two builds interleaved
  in three or more sessions; if a loss persists, attribute it with one build
  per change reverted, the candidates being the `wf__context_pass` call after
  every host operation its start answered, the reap after every 64
  resumptions, the per-driver count of host waits and the stop check's change
  counters. Reopen when a server with more than a few hundred connections or
  with messages of tens of KiB is measured, or before the next change to the
  driver loop.

- **The compiled context server trails the hand-written shape at 64
  connections.** At one driver thread each, `tcp_contexts.wf` held 0.88 of
  `waiting_echo --threads 1` in Experiment 2, 0.84 and 0.93 in Experiment 3
  and a median 0.81 in Experiment 4, whose server CPU per round trip was
  9.80 against 7.93 microseconds with the same system calls
  (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, Experiment 4). About 0.55
  microseconds is the ring's task-run mode: the reference built with the
  runtime's `COOP_TASKRUN` instead of `SINGLE_ISSUER | DEFER_TASKRUN` loses
  0.55. About 0.4 is the general completion engine's user-space work (about
  650 instructions per round trip against the reference's 195). About 0.9
  microseconds of kernel time is unattributed. A ring the driver owns and
  waits on directly, as the reference's, removes the first and most of the
  second. Since Experiment 5 every driver but the entry's has a ring only its
  own thread submits to and reaps, which is the single-issuer condition; the
  entry's ring is also the process's, which threads that are not drivers
  submit to, so it would need a ring of its own first. Reopen with that
  ring, and measure the unattributed kernel time against a smaller working
  set.

- **Frame memory for a context with small state is unmeasured.** Experiment 3
  measured idle connections of `tcp_contexts.wf`, whose 64 KiB echo window
  lives in `serve`'s frame, so frames and stacks both touched about 17 pages
  per connection (70.0 and 68.0 KiB) and the comparison showed only the page
  rounding around the window (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`,
  Experiment 3). Where a stack still touches at least one page per context, a
  frame should touch only its own bytes plus a 1 KiB context record and a
  1 KiB first chunk, which the runtime could allocate as one block. Measure a
  server whose per-connection state is a few hundred bytes, frames against
  the stackful build, before claiming a memory advantage; reopen when a
  program with small per-connection state, such as a proxy that shares its
  buffers, is written.

- **A 16-byte shift of a kernel's code changes its measured speed by 40
  percent.** The `records` compute kernel's hot function,
  `wf__par_seq_summarize_records`, runs about 21 ms at one worker when it
  starts at image offset 0x3200 and about 29 ms at 0x3210, with identical
  instructions: cachegrind counts 2,512,523,716 and 2,512,524,120. One more
  imported libc function adds a PLT entry before `.text`, which is enough to
  move it. The stackful waiting-context floor's `mprotect`, since removed,
  did that, and so did an unrelated `getpagesize` import linked beside the
  base runtime. The measured
  times were 20.7 ms for the base, 29.5 ms for the base with the extra import
  and 28.5 ms for the candidate floor: medians of eleven runs on a 2.1 GHz
  Xeon. `compute-regression` then reports `records` as adverse at two widths
  for a change that leaves the kernel's generated code identical. Every later
  runtime import will do the same. Align emitted functions and loop headers
  (for example 64-byte function alignment, or building kernel objects with
  `-mbranches-within-32B-boundaries`), measure the kernels under both
  placements, and adopt whichever makes their time independent of the
  offset. Reopen when the next compute-regression verdict names a kernel
  whose generated code did not change.

- **Every atomic statement holds its object alone.** Statements whose
  blocks only read could share the object, but lowering always acquires for
  writing
  (`design/language/waiting/shared-objects.md`, the provisional exclusive
  acquisition decision). Readers that contend then wait for one another.
  The runtime's entries take a read request, but lowering makes none, so
  that path runs in no program; deciding it needs a measured workload where
  readers contend, compared with
  a lowering that acquires for reading when the block writes no path rooted
  at the binding. Reopen when a program's atomic statements that only read
  are seen to queue.

- **An atomic statement counts its own handle.** Each statement adds one to
  the object's handle count before it acquires and releases it after it
  unlocks, two atomic read-modify-writes on a shared cache line that keep the
  object live whatever the block does with the target place [SHARE-2]. A
  block that neither moves nor writes the target's root, which is the common
  case and a fact the checker has, needs neither. Measure the uncontended
  statement with and without them; reopen when atomic statements show in a
  profile, as they may in the Redis subset.

- **A shared object takes at least one 512-byte pool block.** The bridge's
  pool serves blocks from 512 bytes up, so a `Shared<u64>` occupies 512
  bytes. A program with one keyspace object does not notice; one with an
  object per client or per key would. A smaller class for objects, or the
  ordinary allocator, would fix it. Reopen when a program creates many small
  objects.

- **No test watches for a write a borrower gives back.** A statement in a
  map's block that borrows a hold handed to a parked context and writes the
  object wakes the contexts watching for a write when it gives the hold back
  (`completion/bridge.c`, `wf_shared_give_back_locked`).
  `completion/shared_object_test.c` steps contexts with hand-written frames
  through every hand-off and borrow, but none of its contexts waits on a
  false guard, so a give-back that left the watchers asleep would pass. The
  change: a context whose guard reads a value only a borrower writes, which
  the test checks wakes after the borrower's give-back. Reopen when the
  lock changes again or a lost watcher wake is suspected.

- **A bound spawn is joined before the whole statement that uses it.**
  [WAIT-3] joins a bound spawn at the beginning of the first later statement
  of its block that names the binding or may leave the block, so in
  `let seen = spawn consume(…); if go { atomic … { … } return seen; }` the
  call is joined before the `if`, and the atomic statement that would make
  its guard true never runs. Joining on the path inside the statement instead
  was refused because later code would merge a joined and an unjoined path
  (`design/compiler/waiting-contexts`, the bound spawn's join). Reopen when a
  program needs the use and the enabling statement in one compound statement.

- **A split loop too small to split still costs its query at every call.**
  Snowghost's layout prototype runs `pkg::text::line_break`, whose
  `write_run_span` loop is a synthesized range split called once per run of
  a paragraph; its runtime work never reaches the work unit. Its layout
  mode that hands out nothing else (L1) is 5 to 24 percent slower at two
  and four workers than at one on every measured page. With that one loop
  made unsplittable in a local build, the flat page's L1 took 1.52 s at
  four workers against 1.57 s at one, where the committed build took 1.80
  s against 1.53 s
  ([Snowghost layout measurement](https://github.com/mbbill/Snowghost/blob/7f7542f/research/investigations/concurrency/DESIGN.md#layout-measurement)).
  The cost is the splitter's runtime query, paid per call when workers
  idle; the retained splitter entry of `compiler/parallel-lowering` was
  qualified on kernels whose splits are few and large. Change to evaluate:
  skip the query when the call's priced work is below the work unit, as the
  caller already knows the extents it prices. Validate with the flat page's
  L1 at one and four workers and the formal kernels' compute regression.
  Reopen with the next range-split or dispatch change.

- **Small allocations in a parallel loop slow down with more workers.** In
  the [scatter measurement](../research/investigations/segmented-storage/DESIGN.md#measurement-where-the-outputs-go)
  a loop allocating one small buffer per item (about 200,000 allocations
  per repetition) took 0.71 s sequentially and 1.15 s and 0.98 s at two
  and four workers. The heap is the platform `malloc` [STOR-8], shared by
  every worker. Change to evaluate: per-worker allocation caches in the
  runtime, or a bump region per split chunk for allocations that die with
  the loop. Validate with that measurement's A2 build at one, two and four
  workers. Reopen when a measured program's per-item allocations sit on a
  parallel loop's critical path.

- **An inline range argument does not carry its length into a routed
  postcondition.** `box_segments_filled`'s record ensures
  `made.inner.len == lengths^.len` on `Some`. When the argument is a
  binding, `let run = &a.inner[0_u64..3_u64];`, the caller learns the
  segment count 3; when the same range is formed at the argument,
  `lengths: &a.inner[0_u64..3_u64]`, `&made.inner[2_u64]` stays unproved,
  so writers must bind the range first
  (`tests/conformance/cases/fn9-pos-segments-routed-count.wf` binds it).
  The formation's endpoint images are recorded under its capture, but the
  clause instantiation reads the argument's length only through a bound
  holder. Change: instantiate a range argument's `len` from the
  formation's captured length as a binding's is. Validate with the inline
  form of that case discharging the bound. Reopen with the next change to
  call-site clause instantiation.

- **An effect-row path through a segment is typed as the whole run.** The
  effect-row resolver (`container_element_type` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/types.rs`) has no `Segments` arm, so a row
  such as `writes(s.inner[k])` with a value parameter `k` selects the
  `Segments` type itself instead of a run of T. No program needs such a
  row yet: a helper takes the segment as its own `&[T]` parameter. Change:
  give a segment index step the range selection a range step has, and add a
  compiler test for a row naming one segment. Reopen when a writer needs a
  row that names one segment of a run it receives whole.

- **A fixed recursion budget cannot follow an unbalanced tree.** The budget
  of `compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds` is now spent only at calls in
  an actualized group, but its depth is still fixed per pool width (about
  eight levels at four workers). Snowghost's style shape B on apollo11 has
  its work under a few children of wide sibling runs, so the halvings above
  it spend the levels and the heavy subtree runs sequentially: a stage
  speedup of 1.14 at four workers, while whole runs with the budget off or
  pinned at 24 are about 3.7 to 3.8 times faster than at one worker
  ([recursion budget at splits](../research/investigations/call-offer-grain/DESIGN.md#the-recursion-budget-at-splits)).
  Candidate change: refresh the budget where offered work is taken by an
  idle worker, so depth follows demand rather than a static count; it
  revises that node and needs a measured comparison on the formal recursive
  kernels (quadrature, merge sort, quicksort) and shape B. Reopen with the
  next Snowghost style measurement or recursion-budget change.

- **The call-offer grain is provisional.** `--par` now offers a
  statement-group call only when its callee reaches a cyclic call component
  or its static work reaches the 150,000 work unit
  ([call-offer grain](../research/investigations/call-offer-grain/DESIGN.md#implementation-results),
  `design/compiler/parallel-lowering.md`). Two known limits no measured program exercises: a
  non-recursive helper whose work is large only through its runtime extents
  loses its offer, and a cheap call into a recursive component keeps one;
  and a callee that reaches recursion only by starting a waiting context is
  not seen as recursive, since neither this pass nor the recursion frontier
  follows a context start as a call edge. Validate any of them by a program whose four-worker time loses to its
  `--par-call-grain off` build; reopen when one appears.

- **Offers beneath a waiting recursion carry no recursion budget.** A
  cyclic component with a waiting member gets no budget-carrying family
  (compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds), because a waiting function is a
  resumable frame with no ordinary entry for a variant to stand behind.
  Every activation of such a recursion therefore reaches its offers
  unbudgeted, as a `--par-recursive-frontier off` build does. In
  `tests/programs/wfgrep.wf` the waiting `walk` and `search_root` recursions
  reached `name_before`'s byte-pair offers at every depth; the call grain now
  omits those offers (static work 4), so wfgrep, the one maintained program
  known to have such offers, no longer does, and whether one costs anything
  is unmeasured.
  Validate with a program whose waiting recursion reaches an offer the grain
  keeps, timed on a deep and on a wide input against a build that withholds
  the offer; if the unbudgeted offers cost measurable time, give waiting
  components a budget-carrying frame variant. Reopen when such a program
  appears.

- **The multi-result-list decision names a set target list the grammar
  lacks.** `design/language/surface-form/multi-result-list.md` says a result
  list is "bound only by a destructuring let or a set target list", but
  [GRAM-4]'s `set_stmt` is `"set" place "=" expr ";"` and the
  specification has no target list. A reader looking for that form finds
  none. Change: drop the set target list from the decision, or add the form
  if a program needs to assign a result list to existing places. Reopen
  with the next edit of that node.

- **A statement that binds an ordered result list never overlaps its
  siblings.** [PAR-1] lets two adjacent statements overlap when their paths
  are disjoint, but the pair judgment in
  `compiler/src/semantic/permission.rs` describes one definition per
  statement and refuses `let (a, b) = f(...);` [CALL-4] as a form, so two
  independent calls that return result lists never run as a pair. The
  counted-loop survey in `compiler/src/semantic/loop_permission.rs` gives
  such a statement its right-hand side's footprint and each binder the
  iteration's own binding; the pair judgment would give each binder its own
  definition path the same way. Validate with two adjacent binder-list
  calls on disjoint storage: permitted as a pair and splitting, with the
  sequential build's output. Reopen when a program's pair of such calls
  costs measurable time.

## Platforms and host interfaces

- **Upstream LLVM on Darwin does not yet support the selected stack-probe
  spelling.** The [Deque comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  records LLVM 22.1.8 rejecting native construction of the unchanged baseline
  with `Unsupported stack probing method`; the emitted
  `"probe-stack"="__chkstk_darwin"` remains present. Parsing and optimization
  succeed, and the native builder's Apple Clang path works, so this does not
  establish a failure of the new address fact. Before offering upstream LLVM
  as a native Darwin consumer, determine the supported probe form and link
  requirements and validate large-frame and recursive exhaustion through the
  existing floor tests. Disabling probes is not an acceptable workaround.
  Defer this separate toolchain extension while the current native path is
  supported; reopen when another native Darwin consumer is required.

- **There is no source-level foreign-function boundary.** C enters only as a
  trusted linked definition of an ordinary declaration [PRE-2, SCOPE-3], which
  the checker cannot inspect, and a C program cannot call Whitefoot code
  through a stated ABI. A real systems program needs both directions: calling
  an existing C library, and exporting a Whitefoot component, which the next
  entry covers. Import needs an explicit contract for ownership, layout,
  callbacks, foreign threads and failure, and a statement of what the
  compiler trusts; a checked wrapper and a source-level replacement are the
  alternatives to compare on one real dependency. This interacts with the
  module design for separate compilation. Close when a specified import
  boundary and its conformance cases land, or the owner records why a
  narrower boundary suffices.
- **Deliver a Whitefoot component as a safe C library.** The owner wants both
  delivery forms studied (2026-09-25): a C, C++ or Rust program should use a
  Whitefoot component the way programs use Wuffs's decoders, without taking
  on Whitefoot's lifetime and alias rules.
  (a) Emit C source for the component, as Wuffs does: portable to any C
  toolchain and reviewable, but the emitted C must never reach C's undefined
  behavior where Whitefoot's meaning is defined (signed overflow, strict
  aliasing, oversized shifts, uninitialized reads), may carry a proved fact
  only through a C construct with the same meaning (`restrict`, an assumption),
  and puts the C compiler in the trusted base in place of LLVM.
  (b) Emit an object or static library and a generated header through the
  existing LLVM backend, with a C-ABI export shim kept apart from the
  compiler's internal function ABI, which can change without notice.
  Either way the exported surface is where Whitefoot's guarantees meet an
  unchecked caller, so, as the
  [C ABI capsule idea](ideas.md#safe-c-abi-capsules) sketches, boundary code
  validates every argument before Whitefoot code receives it (requirements,
  lengths, overlapping buffers, handle generations, ownership transitions,
  the calling thread), and a violation returns an error value with no partial
  mutation; nothing a C caller passes is trusted. Validate one component, such
  as raw DEFLATE decoding or UTF-8 validation, through each route: the capsule
  misuse tests (stale handles, double drop, overlapping buffers, short
  outputs, allocation failure), a C test harness, a fuzzing run through the C
  API, and throughput against the Whitefoot-native build, recording what each
  boundary check costs. The exported interface builds on the module design.
  Take it up after the current correctness fixes land; close when one route
  ships with its boundary specified and tested, or the owner records why one
  route suffices.
- **The driver's clang lookup is a fixed path.** `clang_executable()` in
  `compiler/src/bin/whitefootc.rs` hard-codes `/usr/bin/clang` on Linux/macOS
  (`clang` on PATH on Windows), so a host whose clang lives only elsewhere — a versioned-only `clang-18`, a
  Nix profile, or Homebrew LLVM — cannot run the driver even with clang
  installed. Validate whether to accept an
  explicit override, for example an environment variable, without changing
  which clang CI uses. Close when the owner decides for or against the
  override and, if accepted, its implementation lands.
- **One rejection per compilation.** The pipeline stops at its first
  violation, so an agent with several independent defects — two unproved
  subscripts in different functions, say — meets them one compile at a time.
  [DIAG-1] already leaves the order of violations at distinct nodes open, and
  the [diagnostic record](../research/investigations/readable-diagnostics/DESIGN.md#the-record)
  and its one-object-per-line JSON form can carry several. Reporting more than
  one needs the semantic checker to continue past a `CheckStop` without
  letting a later judgment consume an earlier failed premise, and stays
  deterministic. Unverified benefit: validate with a writer trial counting
  repair rounds on programs with two or more independent defects; reopen when
  such a trial or an agent harness shows the extra rounds dominate.
  One consumer is already promised: [ERR-2] says variant addition "surfaces
  site-enumerated edit lists", yet adding a variant to an enum matched in two
  functions reports only the first non-exhaustive `match` per run. Either
  every ERR-2 site of one enum is listed in a run, or ERR-2's sentence, which
  no other rule defines, is amended to what the toolchain provides.
- **Validate the default diagnostic rendering.** Text by default is
  provisional. The [readable-diagnostics investigation](../research/investigations/readable-diagnostics/DESIGN.md#default-format-text-with-json-on-request)
  selected it on reading cost for an agent (the lean OP-4 and FN-8 records
  measured there are 13-17% smaller than their JSON objects) and on the
  familiar summary-line shape, not on a measured repair loop. Run a writer
  trial over a fixed set of rejections covering lexical, grammar,
  canonical-form and proof families, comparing text and JSON defaults and a
  caret marker against a quoted span, with compile rounds to a fix as the
  criterion. Reopen the default, and the marker form, when that trial or an
  agent harness shows a difference.
- **Structured fields for stops that are not source rejections: declined.**
  Resource, invocation, internal-invariant, target-layout and backend stops
  print their stage value's `Debug` text as one `payload` field. They have no
  writer repair, and no consumer reads their fields separately. Reopen when a
  harness or experiment acts on one of them, for example a resource ceiling a
  writer can raise.
- **Text lists are ambiguous when an item contains `, `.** A diagnostic list
  such as `relations: [a, b]` prints items unquoted, so an item holding `, `
  cannot be split exactly from text. The JSON form carries each item as its
  own string and covers exact parsing; reopen only if an agent misreads such a
  list in practice.
- **The entailment fragment keeps a second resolved-place renderer.** Checker
  payloads (EFF-5, OP-12, REF-2) spell resolved places through
  `render_resolved_place` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions/places.rs`,
  while ENT-6 residuals and goals use `render_place` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/render.rs`, which still renders a payload
  step by its variant and field ordinals and a literal subscript offset
  without its `_u64` suffix. One renderer shared through a small naming seam
  would remove the drift that produced the `<binding:N>` leak; the cost is
  touching every pinned residual that spells a subscript or payload. Validate
  by rendering both families from one function with the pinned-sentence
  corpus unchanged except for the corrected spellings. Deferred from the
  source-spelling fix because no current residual reaches either form in the
  pinned corpus; reopen when one does or when either renderer next changes.
- **A computed call argument has no source spelling in an EFF-5 path.** An
  index position substituted from an argument that is neither a literal, a
  const nor a binding, such as `first: indices[0_u64]`, renders as `?`,
  because the checker captures only the value's identity and not the
  argument's text. Rendering the argument's source extent would name it
  exactly; validate that the extent is available at every capture site and
  that capture identity stays unchanged. Deferred because the separation
  proof already needs a binding there and the rejection names the call;
  reopen when a writer report shows the `?` blocking a repair.
- **A few payload strings still carry non-source forms.** The source-spelling
  fix left three: the FN-9 `relation` field prints the normalized relation
  with unsuffixed literals, such as `"w.value - 0 <= -1"` for
  `ensures result < 0_T`; the goal-literal renderer in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/render.rs` falls back to
  `format!("{other:?}")` for a value it has no source form for, such as an
  array or struct constant; and the SET-1 `InvalidSetTarget` payload prints
  `root_class: format!("{class:?}")`, a resolver class name. Render each in
  its source form, the relation through the same normalized-relation
  renderer with suffixed literals; validate by the pinned-sentence corpus,
  whose only change is the corrected spellings. Deferred because each needs
  its own rendering decision and none blocked the reported repairs; close
  when all three print source forms.

- **A directory named through a symbolic link cannot be opened.**
  `open_directory` opens one component without following a link, which the
  walk relies on to leave enumerated links alone, and the prelude has no
  directory open over a `RelativePath`; `open_read` follows links but opens
  only regular files. So `wfgrep PATTERN ROOT` reports a root that is, or
  passes through, a link to a directory as `cannot read`, where `grep -r`
  follows a link named on its command line. Lifting it needs a prelude
  addition, a directory open over a `RelativePath` resolved as `open_read`
  resolves it, so it is a specification change deferred from the wfgrep root
  fix. Validate with a wfgrep case whose root and whose middle root component
  are links while an enumerated link stays unfollowed. Reopen when a program
  must walk a user-named linked directory.

- **`tests/programs/dir_walk.wf` truncates silently past its fixture.** It
  collects into constant-capacity frame storage and stops recording after 64
  entries in the whole walk, stops descending at depth 8, and clips a path at
  126 bytes, all while exiting 0, although its doc says it records every
  entry. Its one corpus case walks a three-level tree, so no check depends on
  the bounds. Either report each bound or collect through growable storage as
  `wfgrep.wf` now does; reopen when the program is pointed at a larger tree or
  its constant-capacity form stops being the point of the case.

- **A callee in another module is named without the path the call wrote.**
  FN-8's `concrete_callee` renders a callee as its declaration name with its
  instance arguments (`render_function_instance` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions.rs`), so a refuted call written
  `stats::take(counter: &counter, amount: 12_u64)` through a module alias
  prints `concrete_callee: take`. Two modules may each declare `take`
  [MOD-5], so the name alone is ambiguous; the `requires_clause` location
  points at the declaring record, but the payload does not give the spelling
  the call wrote. Render the callee from the call's written callee path,
  alias or `pkg::` prefix included, wherever a payload names a called
  function; validate with a two-module probe in which both modules declare
  the callee's name. Deferred because the location already locates the
  declaration and the change reaches every payload that names a callee;
  reopen when diagnostics for modules are next revised or an agent report
  shows the ambiguity.

- **FN-9 prints its relation in normalized form.** [DIAG-1] fixes the FN-9
  payload as the instantiated normalized relation, so `ensures result <
  10_u64` failing at `return 20_u64;` prints `relation: 20 - 10 <= -1`,
  without type suffixes and with the comparison rewritten as an L0 bound; an
  agent has to translate it back to the clause it wrote. Printing the clause
  with the returned value substituted, `20_u64 < 10_u64`, beside or in place
  of the normalized form would read as written, and needs a DIAG-1 payload
  amendment plus the tests that pin the relation. Validate on the FN-9 probes
  of the [repair-wording investigation](../research/investigations/repair-wording/DESIGN.md#probes)
  and its writer trial; reopen when that work changes the FN-9 payload or a
  writer report shows the normalized form costing a round.

- **Compiler comments cite the retired DIAG-3.** DIAG-3 was the v0.39 runtime
  claim-trap record, retired with claims in v0.40, yet four comments still
  cite it: three for words that are now [DIAG-1]'s (byte identity only where
  selection and encoding are fixed, and the `unproved` or `refuted`
  disposition) in `compiler/src/driver/pinned_sentences.rs`,
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/postconditions.rs` and
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/requires.rs`, and one, the module doc of
  `compiler/src/semantic/permission_ledger.rs`, for the retired record
  itself. A reader following the reference finds no rule. Cite DIAG-1 in the
  first three and drop the ledger's clause; reopen with the next edit of any
  of these files.

- **The callee-`ensures` route can name a call whose result no longer
  reaches the goal.** `call_results` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/repairs.rs`
  traces the values a goal reads back to call results through a closure that
  ignores control flow and intervening writes. In
  `ent5-neg-readonly-field-callee-writes-base`, the loop bound
  `entries[1_u64].width` traces to the `make_entry` call that filled
  `entries`, although the element that reaches the goal was replaced through
  `widen`'s separate `make_entry` call, whose result a statement writes into
  storage without binding it. No `ensures` on `make_entry` relates that width
  to `cells.len`, so the route cannot be carried out there, while the guard
  printed beside it works. The route states the condition it needs, so
  [DIAG-1] holds; the repair is only less direct than it could be. Stop the
  trace at a write that replaces the traced storage before the goal, or offer
  the route only for a value bound from a call and not written since; validate
  with that case and the existing callee-route pins, and reopen when a writer
  report shows the route costing a round.

- **The I/O research record and two runtime comments describe retired
  states.** `research/investigations/io-model/NETWORK.md` says the hand-out
  of a may-suspend call to a pool stack landed and serves `tcp_fanout.wf`'s
  peers concurrently, which spawned contexts [WAIT-3] replace; `DESIGN.md` still says
  canonical `make check` stops on a v0.37 `CANDIDATE` identity; the
  concurrency catalog's retired PAR-3 text and staged-loop sketch predate the
  current rule; the join comment in `compiler/src/backend/completion/bridge.h`
  describes pool stacks rather than contexts; the `.wf` programs under
  `research/experiments/io-completion-bench/programs/` use the retired
  `&uniq` and `own Bool` spellings and no longer compile, as do
  `park-on-miss-measurements/programs/grid_split.wf`, the
  `wfgrep-double-walk/shapes/` programs and the programs
  `differential-fuzz/src/generator.rs` writes, so `read-bench.sh`
  stops at its first build and the spawn work measured single-context reads
  with a scratch loop instead
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 10.5);
  and `.github/workflows/io-bench.yml` says the gate compiles those programs,
  which it does not. A reader following any of them is misled about what
  runs. Mark the research passages
  superseded with a pointer to `WAITS.md`, rewrite the `bridge.h` comment
  against the context scheduler, and either migrate the benchmark programs
  and wire their compilation or delete them with the workflow sentence;
  reopen with the next edit of any of these files or before the next
  read-path measurement.

- **A reserved spelling used as a name does not say it is reserved.** The
  Snowghost renderer's writers found by trial that `copy`, `is` and `checked`
  cannot name a binder [FORM-3]: `let copy = 1_u8;` and `let is = 1_u8;` stop
  as a grammar `UnexpectedToken` expecting an IDENT at `copy`, and
  `let checked = 1_u8;` as `ReservedName` with `class: ModeWord` and an
  inventory ordinal, and neither says that the spelling is a fixed atom or a
  mode word nor which grammar uses it (`capability_bound`, `result_route`,
  the OPNAME and `infix_op` suffixes). The rejection should name the
  reservation and the production that owns the spelling, with a repair to
  choose another name. Validate with a pinned probe per reservation class,
  fixed atom and mode word, in a `let`, a parameter and a field, reading
  that a writer renames on the first round. Reopen with the next change to
  FORM-3 attribution or name reservation.

- **A runtime-formed relative path with several components cannot be
  opened.** `std::fs::relative_path` takes only a `HostString`, which a
  program receives as an argument, and `open_directory` and `open_file`
  open one component each while refusing a symbolic link at every
  component, so a program cannot open `a/b/c` from bytes it read at run
  time, such as a file named in data, when a directory on that path is or
  passes through a link. The Snowghost renderer met this reading resources
  named in its input; the related root case is the linked-directory item
  above. Lifting it needs a specification change: a `RelativePath` formed
  from bytes, validated as `relative_path` validates a `HostString`, or a
  multi-component open that follows links as `open_read` does. Validate with
  a program that reads a path from a file and opens it below a directory
  holding a link, with an enumerated link left unfollowed. Reopen when a
  program must open data-named files below linked directories.

- **Files can only be appended.** `std::fs` opens a file for appending,
  appends, syncs and closes it [PRE-2], and has no positioned write,
  truncation, rename, removal, directory creation, directory sync, create rule
  other than create-if-missing, or way to descend into a subdirectory for
  writing. A program cannot rewrite a log compactly, as Redis's
  `BGREWRITEAOF` writes a new file, syncs it, renames it over the old one and
  syncs the directory, nor clean up a file it made; the append-only surface
  was chosen as the one the persistent programs in view needed
  (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`, "Writable
  directories and append-only files"). Each addition is a specification
  change to `std::fs` taking the write half. Validate with a program that
  rewrites its log through a new file and a rename, and survives being
  stopped between the two steps with one of the two files whole. Reopen when
  a program must rewrite or remove what it wrote.

- **A clock's readings cannot be replaced for a test.** `now` and the
  deadline heap read the host's monotonic clock, so a program's behavior at
  a deadline is tested by waiting for it: the deadline programs and cases
  sleep for tens of milliseconds and cannot show an order of events that
  needs a clock to stand still. A test build could answer the clock from a
  script, as the completion harness already scripts `wf_file_monotonic_ns`.
  Reopen when a test needs a deadline order that real time cannot produce
  reliably.

## Modules and libraries

- **A container operation that takes a callback cannot be called again
  inside its own callback with another callback.** Minimal witness: a
  generic `apply<F, fn visit>` called as `apply::<u64, fn outer>`, where
  `outer` calls `apply::<u64, fn inner>`. The instances end after two, but
  the cycle `apply` to `outer` to `apply` changes the function argument, and
  [FN-6] deliberately refuses every such cycle. firn met it as a
  `hash_map_lookup` on the keyspace whose callback looks a field up with
  `hash_map_lookup` in the hash the key holds; it alternates `hash_map_edit`
  and `hash_map_lookup` instead, which works only while two distinct
  operations fit, and a third level of nesting, or two edits, has no such
  way out. Two repairs are open: a library entry that reaches a stored value
  without a callback, such as a probe that returns the bucket's index for a
  second, bounds-checked access, or an FN-6 that admits a cycle whose
  changed arguments come from a finite set written in the program. Reopen
  when a program needs a third level or two edits nested, or when the
  library's container interfaces are next revised.

- **The standard library has no decimal conversion of integers.** Two
  programs now write their own, firn's `read_number` and `put_decimal`
  (`apps/firn/protocol/protocol.wf`) and `parse_port` in
  `tests/programs/deadlines.wf`, each with its own handling of digits,
  length and room. A program that reads a numeric argument or prints
  a count repeats this, and each copy can differ at the edges (overflow past
  19 digits, an empty field, no room left). The change: a `std::text` entry
  that parses a decimal `u64` from a byte range with a result naming a
  malformed or overlong field, and one that appends a `u64` in decimal into a
  byte window it reports room for; then the two copies move to them.
  Reopen when the library's text interfaces are next revised or a third
  program needs one.

- **Complete the vector boundary witness when comparing independent fields.**
  The maintained GrowVector program checks the shipped vector and behavior
  drains, but does not establish LANGUAGE.md's combined public `tag`, external
  append wrapper and function-kind formal with the complete storage contract.
  The actual vector has only `storage`. Build the specified witness in the
  modular-compilation investigation and check preserved facts after a tag-only
  write versus invalidation after append. This is additional language-boundary
  evidence, not required to measure reuse of the existing vector program;
  reopen when evaluating those independent-field effects or that wrapper API.

- **Finish and qualify the modular incremental design.** The
  [architecture](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/DESIGN.md),
  [source rules](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/LANGUAGE.md)
  and [specimen](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/demo/README.md)
  describe the broader goal. Module verdicts, proof receipts and native object
  reuse exist; composition still repeats structural checking and lowering.
  The owner retired the per-product import implementation after its
  [matched hashing comparison and follow-up screens](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#disposition-of-the-module-product-prototype)
  failed to establish approximately 5% native entry-edit overhead on both
  containers. The independent runtime SHA improvement remains. The complete
  corrected prototype and its dedicated tests are preserved by the linked
  revision; those tests no longer apply to the active compiler.
  Reopen only for a newly requested consumer-boundary experiment: module-owned
  checked results might avoid per-function reconstruction, but their lookup,
  memory and invalidation costs remain unmeasured. Require complete consumed
  inputs, speculative rollback, current composition/target judgments, equal
  fresh/cached results and zero unchanged-library walks. Compare same-source
  paired native and compiler-only costs against equally optimized main, with
  memory, cache history and cold costs; do not count SHA's independent gain as
  an import benefit. The removed prototype's proof-erasing lowering-input
  projection remains an unmeasured alternative in the investigation, not a
  defect in the current compiler. Any future key must retain proof-derived
  allocation bounds, disposition, permissions and physical inputs.
  Further opportunities remain: finer invalidation within an edited module;
  a cold build without a cache, which checks each module and then the whole closure; the impact report,
  which finds each further failing body by checking its module again with
  the earlier ones set aside; ThinLTO's import threshold, which decays along
  a deep cross-fragment call chain and left the innermost step of the
  crossing benchmark's runtime-entry copy out of line (no measurable cost
  there yet; watch for a workload where it shows, and compare import limits
  or grouping); and an executable runner for entries that take other
  parameters than `Inputs` or return other results than `ExitStatus` or
  `unit`, which build only as libraries (`--emit-llvm`). Extract useful cases
  into formal test ownership as each finer mechanism lands; no daily gate
  depends on the research probe or specimen. Compare clean/warm verdicts and
  executables across edits, including changed summary availability with
  unchanged headers, published-field versus private-field changes, hidden
  layout/heap changes, rejected import candidates becoming profitable, and
  failed builds. Measure input-validation I/O, source/proof/planning/
  backend/link work, runtime quality and peak memory separately on the queue,
  GrowVector, wfgrep, SHA-256, a generic-heavy consumer and controlled
  dependency scaling; an exploratory run found source checking and runtime
  construction ahead of LLVM work at current sizes. A source module is not a
  compulsory body/proof/object unit. Benefit: independently verified modules
  for large projects and parallel architect/implementer agents without losing
  runtime optimization; persistence correctness, LLVM integration cost and real
  build/runtime and collaboration gains remain unverified. Reopen structural
  choices when a discriminating control or matched workload fails; remove this
  entry when the complete implementation evidence lands.
  Defer resolved-public-surface CI reporting until
  interface query values exist; its benefit is detecting capability/contract
  changes that a `public` keyword diff misses. Validate same-identity alias
  renames, retargeting and published or private representation edits before
  wiring a report, with no additional approval gate. Named specification
  projections, effect regions, representation-independent model properties
  and mathematical functions remain deferred: they could keep client source
  unchanged across representation edits or express algorithmic models, but add
  abstraction and possibly termination/proof machinery. Reopen for a type that
  must publish a quantity without publishing its storage, or a representation
  migration or contract that makes this cost worthwhile; compare source edits,
  invalidation, interface size and proof cost with published fields, retaining
  deterministic polynomial checking and no runtime proof work. Measure the
  conservative cross-module component rule on real higher-order code; reopen
  it if it withholds postconditions that ordinary programs need. A persistent
  LLVM planning adapter waits for warm-build measurements that show stock
  ThinLTO planning to be a material share of edit latency. External-package
  resolution and composition of libraries other than the standard library
  remain deferred by scope; reopen only when selected by the owner, with
  package identity/version/renaming cases.
  Subtree-private independently compiled modules remain unselected; reconsider
  for a concrete privacy consumer that cannot use one module's private
  implementation files.

## Code structure

- **Five parallel substitution walkers over a type invariant.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/type_invariants.rs` rewrites the invariant's
  parameter zero with `substitute_goal`, `construct_goal`, `binder_goal`,
  `substitute_relation` and `substitute_expanded`, one walker per
  representation (goal, relation and expanded clause) and subject (a
  parameter or its referent, a construction's operands, an atomic binder, an
  exit state or a result). Each is short and has one caller, so a change to
  the datum shape must be repeated in each. A single substitution keyed by
  subject over the expanded clause, from which the goal and relation are then
  formed, would leave one walker; validate by identical verdicts on the
  `type11-*` cases. Found in the TYPE-11 review; reopen when a new subject or
  datum shape is added, such as a fact at an element read.

- **The entailment state module and its tests have outgrown one reader.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/state.rs` has 7,737 lines, including a
  1,729-line inline test module, and the tests in
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/entailment.rs` have 10,920 lines and 156
  tests. The flow itself is divided into its sub-contexts and component
  modules (`design/compiler/engine-components.md`), none over 3,200 lines.
  `state.rs` can move its test module to its own file and its dense-closure
  algorithms apart from the fact state and ledger types; the tests can group
  by the flow component they exercise. Validate that each move changes no
  behavior: identical `make check` results and a diff of moved items and
  module declarations only. Split when no open branch has large edits in
  these files; close when both are under 4,000 lines.

- **Machinery with no remaining consumer.** The checker keeps the region
  machinery STOR-8 retired, though every value it produces is empty:
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/type_regions.rs`, the `region_parameters` of
  function and nominal templates (always created empty), the
  `CheckedNominalKind::Box`'s `region` field, a
  call's `goal_regions` and a `CheckedReleaseClass` with one variant; lowering
  now asserts that the first two are empty and ignores the rest. The flow's
  `is_holder` returns `false`, so `EntryImageHolderConsume` is unreachable, and
  `driver::check_module` has no caller. `IrRuntimeTargetObligations`'s
  `call_site_bound` is `false` in its one constructor, so the byte checks
  `validate_target_obligation` in `compiler/src/target.rs` keeps for a direct
  `BufferFill`, `WindowBlockNew` or `WindowGrow` node with its own bound never
  run; every source bound is qualified per call in
  `validate_source_call_allocations`. Finalize checks every parsed node
  against its production again, the re-verification `design/compiler.md`
  refuses. By reading, generic validation never takes its early return,
  because the prelude's generic signatures are templates in every bundle, so
  every nongeneric body is checked structurally twice; the cost is not
  measured. Remove each with no behavior change (identical verdicts and LLVM),
  timing the double check before and after. Close when each is removed or kept
  with a stated consumer.

- **Native construction lives in the CLI and repeats in the harnesses.**
  The runtime-unit inventory, object caches, LTO flags and linking live in
  `compiler/src/bin/whitefootc.rs`; `compiler/tests/support/mod.rs` keeps a
  second unit inventory with different staged names, the program and
  conformance harnesses link on their own, and `compiler/Makefile` holds a
  third list. `lib.rs` re-exports modules by glob, so no public item is ever
  reported unused, and the driver's fifteen entry points come in cached and
  uncached twins that drop options: `--graph --check` without `--entry`
  ignores `--cache`. One library module for native construction and one
  request type (the
  [architecture investigation](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p5-driver-and-api)'s P5.1 and P5.2)
  remove the copies. Validate with identical executables and verdicts from the
  CLI and every harness. Reopen when a runtime unit or entry point is
  added.

- **Shared checking identities still retain separate judgment work.** P2.3
  removes the rollback, structural type mirror and discovery replay, but
  symbolic and ordinary views conservatively recheck their selected bodies
  and analyses. This preserves the distinct selector universes and consumed
  callee claims; retained symbolic bodies also remain in checked-program
  metadata while lowering selects only the ordinary view. Whether repeated
  judgment work or retained body storage matters is unmeasured. A later
  consumer could key reusable judgments by substitution, checking context and
  consumed claims, or discard unconsumed bodies while retaining their
  identities. Both changes affect the checker, proof metadata and consumers
  that address functions by identity. Defer this extra cache/projection
  machinery until a compiler-cost investigation identifies this work or
  storage as a blocker; compare cached and fresh verdicts, diagnostics and
  emitted output and measure the saved work and retained memory before
  selecting either change. See the
  [inventory design](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p23-one-inventory-without-rollback).

- **Syntax views eagerly build the node-path index.** The shared view now
  serves the graph reader and interface fingerprinting as well as checking;
  those first two consumers use tokens and extents but never node paths.
  Constructing their unused path vectors and sorted lookup index adds work
  whose practical cost is unmeasured. Consider constructing that index on its
  first path query within the same borrowed view. This adds lazy cache state
  and is deferred because no current measurement identifies view setup as a
  blocker. Reopen with the next module-reading performance investigation;
  require unchanged paths, extents and fingerprints, and measure whether the
  saved setup work matters before changing the cache policy.

- **Measure the retained emission model's text storage when backend memory matters.**
  Structured LLVM emission retains definition text for fragment construction
  and a rendered whole-module string for existing text consumers. This can
  duplicate instruction bytes; the practical memory and build-time cost is
  unmeasured. Consider rendering whole-module text lazily or transferring it
  to the final text consumer once fragment construction is complete. Either
  change affects the private output/cache boundary and needs unchanged
  whole-module bytes, fragment bytes and cached/uncached results. Defer from
  the structural migration because no current experiment identifies this
  storage as a blocker; reopen when a larger program's backend profile shows
  material retained text or rendering cost.

- **The range judgment keeps its own model of places and aliases.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/range_judgment/world.rs` models locations, moves
  and aliasing for the range walk beside `compiler/src/semantic/places.rs`,
  which resolves places for ownership and permission. The two can disagree:
  the walk first treated a by-value copy of an array as an alias of its
  source, which `places.rs` never does (fixed; conformance cases
  `range2-neg-copy-is-not-its-source` and `range2-neg-match-binder-copy`),
  and `certified_coverage` in `compiler/src/semantic/loop_permission.rs`
  denies a loop whose certificate's walk skipped an access the permission
  survey sees. Deriving the walk's locations from
  `places.rs`'s resolved places, or sharing one access model, would leave
  one definition of what a statement touches. Validate by identical
  verdicts on the `range*` cases and by the permission tests. Reopen with
  the next change to how either resolves a place, or when a range verdict
  differs from what the ownership judgment says the code touches.

## Open language questions

Questions the owner has left open on purpose. None of them is a decision;
each is resolved by a discussion and a tree change.

- **SHARE-2 names one runtime container in the language.** Its table of
  atomic targets lists `SharedMap<V>` and the forms `m[k]` and `s^[k]`, so
  the rule for holding state by key is written for the one concurrent hash
  index the runtime keeps, and a second keyed container, or the same one
  built another way, would need its own rows. The owner's principle of
  2026-10-02 is that the language states what an atomic statement means for
  every target alike and a container only decides how narrowly it can hold.
  The change to consider: SHARE-2 defines a target that is held by key as an
  abstraction, `SharedMap` being one prelude type that provides it, with the
  container's forms out of the rule. Reopen when a second container held by
  key is proposed, or with the next change to SHARE-2's table.

- **A proof counter has no type without an overflow obligation.** Minimal
  witness: a monitor invariant `produced - consumed == count` over a bounded
  buffer, whose `produced` and `consumed` exist only for the proof and grow
  without bound, so as `u64` fields each increment owes an overflow proof no
  program can give. Ghost state, erased mathematical integers the checker
  reasons about and the lowering never stores, would express it
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 5.3);
  the owner deferred it while spawn was built. Reopen with the first program
  whose invariant needs such a counter.

- **Type invariants stop at the direct struct type.** [TYPE-11] makes a
  struct's invariant a requirement and postcondition of each callable whose
  parameter or result is written as the struct, a construction's obligation,
  and an atomic block's entry fact and exit obligation. A value of the struct
  read from anywhere else, an element of a `Slots<Table, n>`, a field of
  another struct or a `Box` content, gets no fact, and storing one there owes
  nothing, so a function that returns an element must re-establish the
  relation to satisfy its result's postcondition. Instantiating the invariant
  at each such read is sound only once every store owes it, which the
  module boundary of `design/language/checks-and-proofs` permits. Three
  related choices stay open: whether a module-internal helper may take a
  value whose invariant is broken, as SPARK's internal subprograms may;
  whether generic structs and enums may carry invariants; and whether an
  affine invariant (a sum of fields) is admitted through an entry snapshot
  (`research/experiments/monitor-invariants/`). Reopen with the first program
  that keeps invariant-bearing structs in a container, needs a repair helper,
  or needs a sum. The standard library gains nothing from type invariants
  until generic structs may carry them: every `lib/std` collection is
  generic and every I/O type `opaque`. Even then little moves: of the
  priority queue's contract clauses (`lib/std/collections/priority_queue/`,
  interface and body), only `cap <= ceiling`, four `requires`, is a relation
  every value keeps; the rest state one
  operation's precondition (`index < len`, `len > 0`) or its effect
  (`len == entry(len) + 1`), and the maintained programs repeat a field
  relation at most twice. Reopen generic invariants when a generic type has
  a relation every value keeps that several functions restate.
  The [library-Forest derivation](../research/investigations/unique-keys/DESIGN.md#worked-derivation-a-library-forest)
  supplies a generic predicate consumer. Its active route uses explicit
  boundary contracts with checked logical predicates and storage-content
  transport. Validate support invalidation through aliases and interior
  references, generic contract transport, and every promised exit including
  propagation; a partially repaired Forest cannot cross a call requiring
  its full predicate. Continuous validity and simultaneous assignment are
  not prerequisites for that work.
  A stronger lifetime guarantee is separately deferred. The investigation's
  direct-field and reference-helper Pair probes distinguish it from current
  TYPE-11: a legal write can leave unequal fields, and a helper can restore
  equality only on exit. If the stronger rule is reopened, settle its
  observation boundary and test every creation/mutation route, including
  nested storage and intermediate states inside reference calls. Cached
  subtree counts require a runtime-sized update beyond a fixed tuple;
  any unpack/repack alternative for that stronger rule must exclude
  intermediate observations and prove the invariant before republishing.
- **A standard collection restates at every operation that its capacity is
  unchanged.** `ensures queue^.storage.inner.cap == entry(queue)^.storage.inner.cap`
  appears 15 times across the priority queue's interface and body
  (`lib/std/collections/priority_queue/`), and its like 10 times in the
  deque's and 8 in the vector's. It is no type
  invariant, since it relates two states, and the row cannot supply it,
  since those functions write the whole `storage`. A way to say that a
  function preserves a measure, or a row that names the part of a window a
  function writes, would remove most of them. Count the clauses each would
  remove and the proofs that still hold before choosing. Reopen when a new
  collection or a change to window operations adds more such clauses.
- **Remaining value-evidence boundaries.** The
  [investigation](../research/investigations/result-proof-transport/DESIGN.md)
  leaves three related extensions to assess together: borrowed Result
  selection and aggregate/indexed storage, multiple Result destinations from
  one call, and general scalar `give` expressions beyond the existing bare
  atom. These can remove remaining naming/projection workarounds, but storage
  invalidation, cross-result guard identity and evaluated-expression images
  need their own acceptance rules and cost evidence. Reopen when an ordinary
  library example needs one of these boundaries. Validate matched direct/local/
  projected programs, alias and descriptor writes, joins, loop iterations and
  stronger-contract negatives before choosing an extension; do not infer a
  general refinement system from the local-result implementation.
  Conditional fact representation cost is the separate compiler defect above.
  The conversion tests also retain an affine precision boundary: if `index`
  has only an affine image `first + second`, its checked integer conversion's
  saved Result does not preserve that image after `index` is replaced, even
  when a direct access can prove the bound. Conditional contexts carry L0
  relations, not affine value images. Validate whether a real saved-result
  consumer needs that extra relation, using paired direct/saved cases,
  mutation, joins and independent guards, and measure proof cost before
  extending the context; the existing numeric closure alone does not select
  such an extension.
  These language extensions are deferred because the selected ordinary
  local composition rule can be validated without widening the storage or
  predicate vocabulary.
- **Expression composition and canonical source policy.** Reassess mandatory
  three-address computation and intermediate names together with the ban on
  comments and rejection of noncanonical formatting. Compare authoring,
  local refactoring and diagnostic locality on unchanged algorithms and proof
  obligations; assess each restriction's concrete purpose rather than treating
  explicitness or brevity as sufficient grounds. Expression alternatives must
  specify evaluation order, temporary ownership and cleanup, proof invalidation
  and parallel-permission granularity while retaining deterministic parsing.
  Documentation and formatting alternatives must distinguish canonical output
  from the accepted-input boundary and must grant no proof authority to prose.
  No relaxation or authoring-cost improvement is established. Defer selection
  until the syntax review reaches this group; close it only with an explicit
  disposition supported by these comparisons.

- **Independent retention authority remains unestablished.**
  The [multi-object result](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#maintained-composite-correctness)
  establishes a coordinated Slab/HashMap/indexed-heap protocol for both weak
  expiry and retained deletion after both memberships retire. Its independent
  dictionary, expiry-order and owner ledgers cover wrong-store/stale handles,
  both removal orders, reuse and final cleanup; sequential/parallel observed
  images each release all 129 allocations exactly once. The
  [matched comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/indexed-library/RESULTS.md#measured-result)
  grounds the owner's qualified shared-core selection for maintenance, not a
  proven speedup or native parity. The protocol does not protect bookkeeping from
  independently authored mutations: ordinary handles and nodrop tickets do
  not authenticate a Slab or make membership unforgeable, and stable slots do
  not supply surviving references. Defer stronger authority while consumers
  need only the demonstrated coordinated or weak-index contract. Reopen when
  an actual consumer needs independently held tickets or access spanning
  mutations; validate its complete acquisition/release and invalid-use chain,
  ownership cleanup and same-contract native costs before choosing any new
  mechanism.
- **Deque still lacks zero-copy two-span access over Ring.** REF-4 rejects
  every Ring range, even empty and proved non-wrapping ones. The current
  library's slot visitor is not a substitute for a native consumer accepting
  two contiguous extents. A fully initialized Array works for copy elements
  but adds spare-capacity initialization and does not provide arbitrary T.
  The [source analysis](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#ring-range-correspondence)
  identifies the missing contiguous-span interface. An extension needs a
  concrete span consumer, precise empty/non-wrap formation and invalidation
  rules, native-cost comparison and negative wrap/stale-reference cases.
  Defer extension while this library tests endpoint and rebase costs; reopen
  before using it for scatter/gather or another required bulk span consumer.
- **Deque rebase is an explicit new-owner conversion.** Reference-based
  replacement currently loses the exchanged owners' measures; append's
  lower-bound-only contract also lacks the exact sum needed by the library's
  return contract. The current counted take/place conversion supports nodrop
  T without an impossible cleanup branch, but its cost must be separated
  from a two-extent native transfer. The
  [source limits](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#exact-unavailable-source-forms)
  and [cost comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  distinguish interface precision from lowering. Keep the explicit conversion
  for this slice; reopen if a real caller needs automatic reference-based
  growth or rebase dominates its work. Evaluate the already-open affine
  contract question below before choosing a new storage operation; require
  exact length, emptied-old-owner and unchanged element-order evidence.
- **Exact images for non-wrapping wrap forms and lossless shifts.** A
  wrapping add, subtract or multiply whose operand intervals prove it cannot
  wrap, and a shift by a constant that loses no bit, receive their
  [ENT-3.S7] interval and offset relations but not the [ENT-6] affine image
  of the corresponding exact operation. The
  [operation-fact investigation](../research/investigations/automatic-operation-facts/DESIGN.md#42-rejected-alternatives)
  deferred that step (X): no recorded probe needed it, the exact row already
  states the identity, and with the new intervals the exact row is provable
  wherever the step would apply. Reopen when a proof needs the identity and
  the writer cannot use the exact row.
  A width `end -wrap start` computed under the guard `start <= end` is outside
  even that step: the guard is a relation between the operands, and the S7
  row reads only their separate intervals, so the width stays unrelated to a
  range length `end - start` (conformance case
  `ref4-neg-a-wrapped-width-does-not-bound-the-range-length`); the exact
  subtraction under the same guard is the admitted spelling.
- **The two-premise cutoff of automatic affine derivation.** [ENT-6] tries
  zero, one, and two premises and no more without a written certificate. Why
  the line sits at two, against one or three, is not remembered and needs a
  study before it is recorded.

- **A context can neither log nor report back.** Minimal witness:
  `tcp_contexts.wf` with `serve` writing one line to standard output when
  its peer closes. `OutputStream` is `nocopy` and `Inputs` holds one
  `stdout`, so moving it into the first spawned `serve` leaves nothing to
  move on the next iteration; a reference parameter is refused because a
  spawned context outlives its statement [WAIT-3]; and a spawn statement's
  result is released in its context, so
  the starter cannot log on its behalf. A second writer of one standard
  output and the two ends of a channel both fail the sharing rule agreed
  with the owner (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, "Sharing
  between concurrent activities"), because the order of their operations is
  observed. The admitted candidates are a context writing an output of its
  own, a record sink whose observation is the set of records rather than
  their order, and a result that the starter joins where it uses it, which
  [WAIT-3] admits as `let r = spawn f(…)` but only for a call whose starter
  can wait for it, not for an accept loop that never ends.
  Reopen when a context-serving program needs to log or report.
- **ENT-3.S6 names only the bound range's length fact.** S6 establishes
  `part^.len = hi - lo` for `let part = &P[lo..hi];`, while REF-4 states that
  every range's one measure equals `hi - lo` and the value-image rule gives a
  formation's length image without a binding. The checker establishes the
  same S6 relation on the range an argument forms at its call (conformance
  case `ref4-pos-two-ranges-formed-at-a-call-have-equal-lengths`), reading
  REF-4 as the entitlement. Decide whether S6 should say so by naming every
  formation, bound or not; reopen with the next amendment touching S6.

- **An atomic statement over several objects.** `atomic a = &h1, b = &h2`
  would change two objects at one point, as `MULTI`/`EXEC` across keyspaces
  or a transfer between two accounts needs. Two handles may name one object,
  and the checker takes `a` and `b` as disjoint roots, so two writable
  references could reach one state. It needs either a form whose handles are
  known distinct or a runtime rule for the aliasing case with a sound static
  meaning (`research/investigations/io-model/SHARED.md`, "Why a statement").
  Reopen when a program needs two objects changed together.

- **A shared object's state must have drop, and cannot be taken back.**
  `Shared<T: drop>` releases its state with its last handle; a `nodrop`
  state, or a program that wants the value back when it holds the last
  handle, needs a `shared_into` that returns the state and a way to state
  that the caller's handle is the last. Reopen when a program keeps a linear
  value in a shared object.

- **An atomic statement's guard cannot be bounded by a time.** A context
  waiting for a guard [SHARE-3] wakes only when another context changes the
  object, and no deadline or sleep races it, so a context that must act on
  whichever comes first, work arriving or a time passing, polls: the Redis
  subset's append-only file writer wakes every few milliseconds to move the
  buffered changes out instead of waiting for them
  (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`, "What is left
  out"). A deadline on the guard's wait, with a guard-false outcome, would
  express it without polling. Validate with the writer rewritten to wait on
  its buffer with a one-second deadline, comparing its wakeups and latency
  with the polling one. Reopen when a program must wake on the earlier of an
  object's change and a time, or when the polling writer's cost shows in a
  profile.

- **A function that states a range clause cannot be a function-kind
  actual.** RANGE-1 refuses a range clause in a `fn_sig` contract, so no
  function-kind formal can declare one, and a `fn_decl` whose requirements
  or postconditions include a range clause is refused as the actual of
  such a formal, as `whitefootc` reports "a function signature's contract
  states a range clause". Impact: generic code that takes a function cannot
  take a producer that hands back range facts, or a consumer that requires
  them; no program has needed one yet. Change: admit range clauses in a
  `fn_sig` contract, matched clause by clause against the actual's, with
  the formal's clauses owed and taken at the call as a direct call's are.
  Validate by a generic driver that takes `ramp` of
  `tests/conformance/cases/range3-pos-postcondition-producer.wf` through a
  function parameter. Reopen when a program passes such a function.

- **A function cannot pass on a callee's routed range postcondition.** A
  function that returns a callee's `Option` or `Result` unchanged, `return
  move made;` after `let made = ramp(n: n);`, cannot promise the callee's
  routed range postcondition again: the range walk holds a routed fact only
  in a `match` arm that takes its variant [RANGE-2], so the return owes the
  payload fact unproved. The writer matches and returns a new construction
  of the payload, which costs a match and a move per forwarding layer.
  Change: let a routed fact over a location stay attached to it, so a
  return of that location selects and discharges the same route. Validate
  by a forwarding wrapper accepted unchanged and a wrapper that forwards
  the other variant still refused. Reopen when a program forwards a
  producer's result through a wrapper.

- **Parameters a contract names but the body does not use are passed at
  run time.** A range requirement can only name what the callee receives,
  so `cascade_level` in
  `tests/conformance/cases/range5-pos-level-cascade.wf` takes `positions`,
  `depths` and `level` only so that its `listed` and `up` requirements can
  state the facts its certificate uses; the caller passes them on every
  call. Each costs a pointer and a length or one integer per call, which the
  measured cascade does not show, but a writer must keep proof-only data
  alive and in scope to call such a function. A proof-only parameter that
  lowering erases would need its own rule for what such a parameter may
  flow into. Validate by measuring the call cost in a cascade with small
  levels and by counting the functions in Snowghost whose parameters only
  their contract reads. Reopen when that cost shows in a profile or a
  writer must compute a value only to pass it.

## Ownership redesign (candidate x1) follow-ups

Items the owner asked to be kept on this list during the redesign recorded in
`research/investigations/access-effects/CANDIDATE-X1.md` and adopted into
`design/language` on 2026-09-19. None of them is a decision; each names the
condition under which it is taken up.

- **Fixed-resource execution with proved completion — deferred.** Resume from
  the [research checkpoint](../research/investigations/fixed-resource-execution/README.md#deferred-work-and-resumption),
  which preserves the stack, recursion, loop, allocation/runtime and cleanup
  findings, proposals, probes and remaining validation. The goal is no heap,
  proved completion and peak storage within supplied byte capacities; a depth
  cap or `program no_heap;` alone does not establish it. Automatic qualification
  is unimplemented, the diagnostic stack ledger has coverage/geometry gaps,
  and general recursive release can still grow with value depth. Work is
  deferred until this topic is explicitly resumed. Start by rechecking the
  recorded compiler/target assumptions, then the complete acyclic stack-byte
  inventory; preserve unknown-call/alignment controls and exact budget-boundary
  cases. Progress proofs and full resource closure follow separately. The
  checkpoint also retains the consumer conditions for mutual tail transfers,
  general cleanup lowering and total-work estimation; none is scheduled now.
- **Facts a contract can carry (owner, 2026-09-20).**
  Three additive widenings, taken up together, each measured:
  (1) Affine `ensures`. A `requires` may already be an affine relation and
  enters the body as affine premises, but an `ensures` must fit the
  difference-bound template, one datum a side, so `append` and `split_off`
  cannot publish their exact sum. The affine layer [ENT-6] already holds
  arbitrary affine inequalities over immutable value atoms and proves with
  the fixed AUTO families, so publishing an `ensures` as affine premises in
  the caller changes neither determinism nor termination. Costs to
  measure first: AUTO tries every pair of premises, so checking time grows
  with the square of the premises a body accumulates; and a proof chaining
  more than two published facts needs written `use` steps. When it lands,
  restore the exact-sum contracts of `append` and `split_off`.
  (2) A `requires` stating a variant refinement (`p is Some`).
  (3) An `ensures` naming a single indexed path
  (`p.slots^[h.idx].gen == h.gen`), which decides whether a guarded
  pool access pays one load, compare and branch per call.
  Reopen with a library operation that needs one of these facts; retain the
  exact refused clause and its best ordinary implementation. Validate support
  invalidation, aliasing, entry/exit and index changes, ownership outcomes and
  checking cost as well as the runtime check or source work saved. The Slab
  and Deque [source limits](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#exact-unavailable-source-forms)
  remain examples, not an amendment or a claim that runtime state is lost.
- **Custom outcome contracts remain restricted.**
  FN-9 admits exit-state fragment-integer fields of written references, and
  CALL-4 admits selected fields and measures of success payloads. Routing is
  still limited to the success variants of the prelude Result and Option: a
  custom `Inserted / Replaced / Full` outcome cannot directly publish a
  different length relation for each variant. An unconditional insertion
  interval alone does not prove that a failed first attempt leaves length
  unchanged before a retry. Keep exact source refusals and the best ordinary
  interfaces in the [map trial](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison).
  Reopen when a caller needs those facts: compare ordinary re-reads or a
  separate numeric result with richer publication, measuring remaining checks,
  result transfers and checking cost. Validate entry/exit substitution, writes
  through aliases and incorrect variant claims before selecting any extension.
  Defer language changes while the complete map can use ordinary checked
  accesses; no runtime data or ownership state is missing.
- **Affine equality in call requirements has a narrower route than invariants.**
  The [map proof reduction](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  verifies a local equality after a counted loop but rejects the identical
  equality as a callee requirement. INV-1 splits equality into two affine
  inequalities; ENT-6's signed FN-8 normalization lists ordering leaves only.
  Splitting that one requirement into `<=` and `>=` admits the unchanged
  algorithm without runtime checks. This is a specified proof-shape limit,
  not an observed compiler violation. Reopen with contract-proof work to
  assess consistent equality decomposition, including false equalities,
  negative goals, alias invalidation and deterministic checking cost. Defer
  a rule change while the exact paired-bound interface supplies the needed
  proof without runtime or ownership cost.
- **Container replacement and measure transport.** PRE-1's
  `swap` declares writes to both referents and no postcondition; MSR-3's
  placement rules do not include swap. Exchanging two boxed windows therefore
  kills their supported length/capacity facts without connecting the incoming
  descriptor to the new place. Actual values and unique ownership still move
  correctly. The direct map-migration trial can re-read bounds, but cannot
  derive its promised nondecreasing extent merely from the pre-swap facts.
  Reopen with the contract-publication work: retain scalar-only and nested
  owner controls, alias invalidation and input/output swaps, and compare the
  source/proof benefit with checking cost before selecting a general relation.
  The [Deque reference-rebuild probes](../research/investigations/contract-surface/OWNERSHIP.md#deque-reference-rebuild-probes)
  expose a stronger consumer: swapping in the completed backing loses the
  emptied old backing's zero length needed by `free_empty`. An OP-12 wrapper
  instead rejects an unbounded element type under WIN-3 because its target
  may be linear; adding `T: drop` excludes supported elements and still leaves
  its exact length postcondition unproved under FN-9. Classify that latter
  establishment limit against the current rules before choosing a compiler
  fix or a language extension. Compare a general swap relation with measured
  atomic-result publication and possible linear atomic updates, retaining
  no-hole ownership, no implicit linear release, failure-exit rules and
  reference invalidation. Use the existing scalar/boxed/nodrop/unit Deque
  oracle and its exact length/capacity/head contract; no extra runtime proof
  branch may count as the same-contract success. Defer changes from the
  syntax investigation while the owned rebase meets that contract; reopen
  when selecting its reference counterpart. Do not manufacture an impossible
  branch or weaken a postcondition to complete the comparison.
- **Conditional measure controls expose a branch-join limit.** A counted-loop control calling a length/capacity-preserving
  helper in only one arm rejects its backedge facts, as do lockstep growth
  under a branch and a binary search that updates `low` in one arm and `high`
  in the other. The [branch-join investigation](../research/investigations/branch-join-relations/DESIGN.md)
  classifies these as the specification as written, not compiler defects: an
  invariant's conclusion is an affine theorem only, the pre-kill closure and
  the join keep only L0 facts, and the join gives each changed binding a
  fresh atom (INV-1, ENT-5, ENT-6). Its reduced sparse-map loop fails for that
  reason and is admitted by capturing the extent before the branch; the full
  loop the [exact controls](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  record as still refused with an explicit extent bridge is written in
  retired syntax and was not reproduced. A prototype that also establishes a
  proved unit-coefficient invariant as an L0 relation admits the complete
  line-break and CSS rewrites; with two midpoint rows it admits loop searches.
  Its [cost replay](../research/investigations/branch-join-relations/DESIGN.md#current-cost-results)
  does not qualify the proposals: HTML tree-building peak RSS exceeds the
  recorded 10% criterion under the invariant projection, and Vector's inert
  control itself exceeds that threshold, so its row-only result cannot be
  attributed to the candidate. Keep the admitted wrapper and captures.
  Reopen rule selection when a real consumer needs the simpler source, after
  attributing memory growth and repeating the affected comparisons with a
  qualified control; retain the original time/RSS criterion and source-rule
  negatives. Reduce and classify the full sparse-map loop separately.
- **Owning HashMap has a remaining large-value performance gap.** The
  [matched comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md)
  exercises the actual generic library, including must-consume pairs, without
  requiring one Box per payload. Its compact result and direct enum migration
  improve the original planned sparse source, but the measured 256-byte-value
  growth trace still costs about 1.64–1.69 times direct C with the same
  migration direction, and replacement about 2.09–2.35 times. These are
  complete checked traces, not isolated copy costs.
  In that baseline, optimized migration initializes inactive payload bytes,
  stages live pairs and reads the displaced payload before its tag is used.
  The rejected unchanged-source initialization candidate above reduces the
  measured wide growth gap to about 1.19 times direct C with ordinary helpers and
  1.27--1.29 times with retained helpers, but normal replacement worsens to
  2.26--2.29 times and retained replacement remains 2.16--2.23 times. Public
  owning results still retain transfers. A forwarding follow-up must preserve
  every owner-return path and distinguish code-generation changes from their
  measured contribution; copy counts alone do not establish that contribution.
  Dense storage remains faster for wide growth but adds reserved metadata and
  dependent lookup, while a fresh sparse rehash retains two complete backings.
  Reopen for a workload dominated by these costs, preserving full backing and
  peak bytes, hash/load policy, retained helpers and exact cleanup. Defer a
  second maintained representation until that consumer supplies its grounds;
  the rejected compiler trial's optimizer losses and reopening grounds are
  recorded above.
  SIMD-group probing and a general projected-storage benefit remain untested;
  the earlier [native hash-slot study](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/blob/38c28403a2defd0b65b8a2ab2b5e4794315e9940/research/experiments/hash-slot-occupancy/RESULTS.md)
  did not establish a recurring tag-check tax. A working library does not
  close either question or imply a universal native-performance ceiling.

- **Ordered insertion replacement costs need attribution.** Both the
  [aggregate-result candidate](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#single-descent-insertion-candidate)
  and [borrowed-promotion follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#borrowed-promotion-follow-up)
  regress on replacement despite insertion gains. The second removes recursive
  aggregate clearing without curing the loss. One promotion-slot initialization
  per put, Pair placement/swap/result transfers, occupancy checks and substantial
  stack frames remain; their elapsed shares are not isolated. Avoiding the
  baseline's duplicate miss search and recursive Pair transport remains useful
  only if replacement cost is preserved. Defer another source variant: no third
  candidate belongs to this completed comparison. Reopen when a concrete
  consumer or controlled source/lowering discriminator isolates a material
  cause and supplies grounds for a new experiment. Validate unchanged owner
  identities, refusal behavior and exact release/allocation counts, then the
  complete normal/retained matrix including replacement cells and independent
  control observations. Keep general aggregate-result ABI and placement work
  under the existing compiler items; a different return form alone no longer
  supplies the reopening ground.

- **Ordered-map occupancy and tree choice remain workload-dependent.** The
  [reserved-storage comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#allocations-and-reserved-storage)
  records 48.6% peak reserved-slot utilization during 4096-pair bundled-tree
  churn, versus 74.6% for direct C; wide peak storage is about 2.37 MB versus
  1.50 MB and native AVL's 1.18 MB. A different repair policy or tree shape
  could reduce vacant wide storage and churn cost. This is one deterministic
  stream, not an occupancy histogram or a measured WF AVL. First attribute
  node growth to split/merge and reinsertion with per-node occupancy evidence;
  then compare one justified alternative under the complete arbitrary-owner
  map contract, including replacement/refusal, range visits, exact cleanup,
  requested/peak bytes and normal/retained timings. Scalar and range tradeoffs
  must remain visible. Defer a second maintained representation until a
  concrete index supplies its governing
  workload; reopen before choosing a default ordered representation or when
  an index is dominated by wide reserved storage or churn.

- **Channel primitive.** An ownership-transfer queue in the trusted base for
  producer/consumer pipelines and work stealing; lock-free rings are not
  expressible without it and batched fork-join is the available form. Research
  when the future concurrency primitives are designed.
- **Header-plus-tail heap block.** One allocation holding a fixed header and a
  runtime-length tail (LLVM `User` with its operand list, `sk_buff`). Today a
  boxed struct with a `Box<Slots<T>>` field costs two allocations and an extra
  dependent access; an inline struct plus a boxed tail uses one allocation
  but a wider handle and separated header. An encoded byte block is another
  available representation with codec costs. TYPE-9 still excludes a typed
  runtime-capacity tail inside a source struct; the
  [layout comparison](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#ceiling-challenges-connected-to-real-source-contracts)
  separates these contracts. Two shapes
  under discussion: (a) a struct whose last field is a runtime-capacity shape
  becomes itself Box-only content, laid out `[header fields | len | cap |
  elements]`, which needs a construction route that knows the capacity, a
  `grow` that moves the whole block, and the no-move-out rule extended to
  it; (b) one more prelude storage shape carrying a header value beside its
  window, built by a construction function taking the header and the
  capacity, which needs no new struct rule.
  Undecided (owner, 2026-09-20: revisit later). Notes for that discussion:
  the tail is always the last field and always one of the runtime-capacity
  shapes; a `Slots` or `Ring` tail starts empty, an `Array` tail does not
  (it needs a fill value and a count); a construction sketch is
  `box_new_tail::<Message>(value: Message(kind: 1_u8, flags: 0_u8, body: _),
  capacity: n)`, where the capacity is an argument of the boxing function,
  the expression with the hole is admitted only as that argument because
  such a struct is never a local value, and `_` would be a new token
  (`..` exists already as the destructuring rest marker).
  Reopen when a concrete typed-header/tail consumer needs the compact owning
  handle or adjacent layout. Compare full allocation bytes, dependent accesses,
  initialization, movement/growth and cleanup against both ordinary alternatives;
  no new layout or construction spelling is selected without that evidence.
- **Bitmask fact.** `x & (c - 1) < c` for a power-of-two `c`, which would
  remove the per-probe bounds compare in hash tables.
- **Handing checker facts to the backend.** Emitted since the v0.60 port:
  `noalias` (not on `swap`), `nonnull`, `dereferenceable`,
  `captures(none)` or `nocapture` by a build-time probe, `inbounds`, and
  `nuw`/`nsw` on the exact family. A `&[T]` range parameter crosses calls as
  its element pointer and count, and the pointer carries the same facts
  except `dereferenceable` (`compiler/backend-facts`; the
  [range-reference fact investigation](../research/investigations/range-reference-facts/DESIGN.md)
  records the derivation and the removed vectorizer overlap check). The later
  qualified Ring payload-address
  `llvm.assume` is measured in the [Deque comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md);
  its remaining costs are tracked above. Not emitted: `memory(argmem: ...)` (the
  IR carries neither the declared row nor the allocation fact), scoped
  alias metadata and `llvm.loop.parallel_accesses` (the emitter has no
  metadata table). Build the metadata subsystem as its own step with a
  before/after benchmark.
- **Subscripted integer places as terms.** A place with subscripts is a
  term only when its last step is a readonly field, a measure or a writer's
  own (v0.71, [investigation](../research/investigations/readonly-field-terms/DESIGN.md#alternatives)).
  The kill machinery (offset support, overlapping element writes) serves
  every such term, so generalizing to every integer place is cheap in
  mechanism, but a field updated in place loses its facts at every element
  write whose index is not proved distinct. Measure the effect on closure
  size and checking time on a program that updates element fields in loops
  before selecting it; reopen when such a program needs a fact about a
  writable element field that a `let` copy cannot carry.
- **Readonly-field terms stop at L0.** A readonly field below a subscript is
  an ENT-2 term for comparisons, requirements, copies and counted endpoints,
  but it is no FN-9 relation datum, no INV-1 atom and has no ENT-6 affine
  image, so `ensures result <= nodes^[i].count` is refused and
  `requires nodes^[i].first + nodes^[i].count <= kids^.len`
  gives the body no usable affine premise. FN-9 needs the formal offset
  substituted on both the body and the caller side and an `ensures` place
  judged where it is formed (see the next entry); affine images need their
  kill to follow the term's support, as measure atoms do. Validate with paired published and local cases, a kill of
  each support member, and unchanged verdicts elsewhere; reopen when an
  index-based program needs one of these surfaces.
- **FN-9 relations read a formal subscript as an unknown offset.** A
  published relation over `rows^[i].len` with `i` a formal renders as
  `entry(rows)^[?].len`: the body side and the caller side
  (`call_parameter_place`) turn `GoalProjection::FormalSubscript` into an
  unknown capture instead of the parameter binding or the actual's offset,
  as requirement instantiation already does. Nothing but standing facts is
  provable about that term, so the relation is unusable rather than unsound
  today, but any extension of what can be proved about it would conflate the
  elements of two calls. Nothing judges the subscript of an `ensures` place
  either: ENT-2 fixes where a requirement's places are formed, at body entry,
  but not an `ensures` place's, and `ensures r <= rows^[i].len` with
  `i` unconstrained is accepted. The extension must form such a place where
  its relation is judged, each selected return, with its subscripts owing
  OP-4 there, and state that point in ENT-2. Substitute the formal on both
  sides, judge the subscripts, then add a case whose caller publishes over
  two different offsets and must not equate them. Owner (PR #118 ruling,
  2026-09-25): later, by the same principle at each selected return.
- **Affine premises over a reference parameter's fields do not reach the
  body.** `requires s^.a + s^.b <= 100_u64` over the fields of `&Accounts`
  gives the body no premise that bounds `b + n` after `let b = s^.b`, while
  the same `requires` over value parameters does, and stated over entry
  values tied to the fields by L0 equalities it does too. A smaller case: an
  L0 `requires s^.a >= n` does not discharge `s^.a - n` written on the
  place, but does after `let a = s^.a`.

  `research/experiments/monitor-invariants/` holds both as probes
  (`bank-field-premise`, `field-premise-direct`). The first is the gap of
  "Readonly-field terms stop at L0" for a plain field: affine images of
  place terms need kills that follow their support. A monitor invariant over
  a sum of fields needs it, or an entry snapshot. Reopen with the object
  invariant, or when a contract over a structure's fields needs a sum.
- **Tracked-place offsets with projections are not captured.** ENT-2 admits
  any clause (a) term as an offset, but the compiler captures only literals,
  consts and bare bindings. A measure read such as `table[s.k].len` and a
  readonly-field read such as `nodes[n.parent_slot].count` or
  `nodes^[r^].count` are reported unsupported, never rejected, and
  so is such a place in a contract clause. Capture such offsets with their own
  support (the field place, the reference's referent) and a spelling identity
  that keeps `n.a` and `n.b` apart, so OWN-7 separation and ENT-5 kills read
  them; validate with a write to the offset's field, to its root and to a
  sibling field. Until then, bind the offset with `let` first.
- **Readonly-field offsets.** ENT-2 admits a clause (a) or (c) term as an
  offset. A clause (b) term, such as `nodes[nodes[i].parent].count` in a tree
  with parent indices, is equally tracked by the fact system and would be a
  principled recursive extension; it is refused today (no term) to keep the
  offset rule non-recursive. Reopen when an index-based program needs it,
  after the capture above; validate with kills of the inner element, the
  inner offset and the outer element.
- **PAR-1 proves no window liveness and no index outside a range.** WIN-2
  separates `r[i]` from `r.next` and `r.free` only where `i < r.len` is
  proved, and a range from them only where `hi <= r.len` is. PAR-1's
  footprints carry an effect row's index and endpoints as unknown values,
  and an offset no captured value names as the same value, so a statement
  pair meeting on a part and such an index or range gets no overlap
  permission even when the subscript or range was formed in the compared
  state. PAR-1 also poses no query for OWN-7's index-and-range family, so
  an index beside a range separates only by written literals. This loses
  permission only. Reopen when a program needs it: carry the row's argument
  captures into the footprint and ask the entailment fragment for the bound
  or the ordering, as EFF-5 already does through
  `CheckedCallSeparationPositions`.
- **A kill event proves no two positions apart.** OWN-7 separates two
  indices, two ranges, or an index and a range where the current
  ProofContext proves them apart, but an ENT-5 kill asks only written
  literals and the separations an EFF-5 call recorded in the flow's ledger.
  So in a body that requires `i < j`, a fact over `rows^[i].len` dies
  at `set rows^[j] = move fresh`, and a later read that needs it is
  refused although the specification separates the two; a fact at an index
  before a range a callee writes through dies the same way. Asking the
  entailment fragment only for a fact whose place meets a written position
  under the same base, as event liveness asks, keeps the added proofs
  bounded. Validate with that body accepted and one requiring only
  `i <= j` still refused. Found while adding OWN-7's index-and-range
  family; the gap is older than the family.
- **A call ends a window reference's bound without reading the callee's
  `ensures`.** OP-10 keeps a reference into a window valid while the bound
  it was formed under holds, and `place_back`'s `ensures` carries that bound
  across the call. The checker instead ends it at every call of `take_back`,
  `remove_at`, `append`, `split_off`, `place_front`, `take_front` or
  `grow`, and at every other call whose row writes the window's `last` or
  `filled`, whatever the callee ensures. So `&front[0_u64]` dies at
  `append(destination: &front, source: &back)` although `append` ensures
  `destination^.len >= entry(destination)^.len`, and a slot
  reference dies at a user function declared `writes(window.last),
  writes(window.next), writes(window.len)` that takes one element back,
  places one back and ensures `window^.len ==
  entry(window)^.len`. The v0.73 checker accepted the second, since it
  ended no bound at a user call, which also let a reference outlive a user
  function that took its slot back. This refuses programs only. Reopen when
  a program needs such a reference: after the call, ask the entailment
  fragment whether the bound still holds in the call's exit state, as an
  event asks liveness in its entry state, and end the reference only where
  it is unproved. Validate with both programs accepted, the same callee
  without its `ensures` still ending the reference, and a reference below
  the slot still dying by REF-2's prefix rule.
- **Two range steps are identical only as one formation.** OWN-7 compares
  two ranges, or an index and a range, under containing paths that are
  identical step for step or differ only in index steps. The checker counts
  two range steps as identical only when they come from one formation, so
  after `let left = &values^[a..b];` and
  `let right = &values^[a..b];`, with `a` and `b` unwritten between
  them, a call passing `&left^[0_u64..2_u64]` and
  `&right^[2_u64..4_u64]` is refused with EFF-5 although both frames
  captured the same endpoints. The v0.73 checker refuses it too. The
  specification does not say whether two range steps whose captured
  endpoints are equal are identical; whether the checker proves such steps
  identical from their endpoints or OWN-7 defines a range step's identity by
  its formation is the owner's choice. Validate with that call once the
  ruling admits or refuses it. Found by the recheck of PR #141's
  containing-path ruling.
- **OP-11 admits equal-depth slots under one identical array or window
  only.** The checker also admits them under containing paths that differ
  only in index steps: `swap(first: &outer^[i][k], second:
  &outer^[j][l])` with nothing relating `i` and `j` is accepted by the
  v0.73 and v0.74 checkers. Two slots of equal depth are one storage or two
  disjoint ones, so the acceptance is sound, but the checker admits calls
  the specification's wording refuses, the gap the owner closed for OWN-7's
  range families on 2026-09-26. Decide whether OP-11 states the relation
  the checker implements or the checker requires one identical array or
  window. Validate with that swap. Found by the recheck of PR #141's
  containing-path ruling.
- **Vocabulary no declaration can state.** The `len` of a range reference
  (`&[T]` is a kind, not a type) and the four effect-row part names `next`,
  `last`, `filled`, `free` remain specification vocabulary after the
  measures became declared readonly fields. Find a better home for them.
- **The storage shape declarations are inelegant.** `Array`, `Slots` and
  `Ring` are prelude opaque structs with readonly fields, but the
  omitted-capacity form, element storage and placement still live in the
  type rules, and a constant-capacity `cap` is a field whose value is a
  type constant.
- **Retire the class names copy, affine and linear from the specification's
  prose.** The keywords are the two capabilities `copy` and `drop` and the
  modifiers `nocopy` and `nodrop`; the three class names survive only as
  prose terms defined once in OWN-1 (copy: copyable; affine: droppable but
  not copyable; linear: neither). Rewrite the several hundred prose uses in
  capability words when a specification pass can afford the review.
- **Unmeasured performance claims from the ownership-redesign matrix.**
  The v0.60 port has landed; the current Vector, Slab and Deque comparisons
  establish only their stated operation contracts and toolchains. The earlier
  matrix's costs for data-determined index checks, refused scatter,
  find-then-mutate re-descent and construction into an append slot still need
  current source and native controls where those comparisons do not cover them.
  Reopen the affected claim when a container or systems workload exercises it,
  preserving its ownership, order, overlap and allocation contract and separating
  required source work from removable lowering cost. Defer a broad repeat of all
  eight engineering tasks until it answers a concrete selection question;
  a passing new library does not dispose of the remaining matrix claims.
- **A write refused for a written index parameter does not name that
  write.** After `set index = 0_u64`, a body write `window^[index]`
  under `writes(window[index])` is refused with SET-1's "a reference whose
  declared row does not write this path", and a call passing `index` with
  EFF-2's repair `writes(window)`. Neither names the earlier write of
  `index` that moved the access off the row's position, which a writer who
  declared `writes(window[index])` needs to see. Name the write, and offer
  the repair that keeps the row: read `index` into a new binding before
  writing it. Validate with a pinned pair for each of the two rejections.
  Found while fixing the EFF-2 attribution after a parameter write.
- **A goal over an index no spelling names offers routes that cannot
  establish it.** After `let wr = &rows[k];` and `set k = 1_u64;`, a call's
  requirement through `wr` reads `rows[?].len`, and FN-8's repair offers an
  `invariant` whose `use` steps name the facts implying it, or a guard whose
  condition establishes it. No fact or condition names that row, so
  neither can succeed, while binding the index first, `let k0 = k;` and
  `let wr = &rows[k0];`, does. An index a loop-rebound holder carries, also
  rendered `?`, gets the same two routes, and there forming the reference
  after the rebinding is what works. Select the route from what the `?`
  stands for, and pin each pair with a repaired source that is accepted.
  Found while fixing the completion review of PR #145.

## Verification tooling

- **The trusted runtime is large and growing.** Every program links about
  20,000 lines of C and LLVM IR in `compiler/src/backend` that no checker
  reads (the scheduler, the completion bridge at 3,871 lines, the hosts' I/O
  adapters, the concurrent map at 1,130), and each language feature has
  added to it: the shared map's first claim protocol let one key hold two
  cells until a review found it
  (`research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md`, reuse and a key's
  second cell). The change: keep in C only a few primitives Whitefoot
  cannot state (atomic loads, stores and compare-and-swap with their
  orderings, parking and waking a thread, the host's system calls and
  memory mapping) and write the rest, the map's probing and moves, the
  shared objects' queues and hand-off, the I/O adapters' bookkeeping, in
  Whitefoot over them, so the checker proves their memory safety and
  bounds. It needs the language to express atomics and their orderings,
  which it does not today. Measure each move against the C it replaces on
  the duel and the suite. Reopen when the language gains atomics, or before
  the runtime's next large addition.

- **Nothing checks the runtime's concurrent protocols.** The map's claim,
  settle, move, hold and patience protocols, the shared objects' park,
  hand-off and borrowed holds, the scheduler's queues and the completion
  bridge's wakes are
  argued in comments and exercised by stress tests and mutants
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map_test.c`,
  `compiler/src/backend/completion/shared_object_test.c`), which find an
  interleaving only when it happens to occur; no model of their states and
  memory orderings is checked, so a protocol can be wrong in an order no
  test reaches, as the map's first claim protocol was. The change: model
  each protocol in TLA+ and check its safety (one holder per key and per
  object, no lost update, no cycle of waits) and liveness (every begun
  statement takes effect [WAIT-2]) with TLC over small configurations;
  check the C itself under the C11 memory model with a stateless model
  checker such as GenMC, which explores the weak-memory orders a model
  abstracts; and where a protocol is small enough, prove it, for example
  in Iris. Start with the map's claim and the objects' hand-off, the two
  the last review found wanting. Reopen with the next change to a runtime
  protocol, or with the move of the runtime into Whitefoot above, whose
  primitives such models would specify.

- **No command renders a program in canonical form.** [FORM-2] refuses a
  program that is not in canonical form, and the compiler has the renderer
  (`render_canonical`, which the canonical corpus test calls), but neither
  `whitefootc` nor a `make` target exposes it, so a writer repairs layout by
  hand from the diagnostic's one marked position. Writing firn's 5,400 lines
  needed a scratch binary over the `whitefoot` crate that rewrites files in
  place. Add a `whitefootc --format <files>` mode that rewrites each file to
  its rendering and fails on one that does not parse; validate that it
  leaves every canonical corpus file unchanged and repairs a file with
  reordered spacing. Reopen with the next program written outside the
  corpus, or when the driver's modes are next changed.

- **Nothing refuses a test that runs a compiled program without a
  deadline.** Every current test that runs a program it compiled goes
  through the owned process in `compiler/tests/support/process.rs`, which
  stops it after 60 s, but a new test that calls `Command::output`,
  `status` or `spawn` on its executable waits without limit again, and only
  review would notice; four such waits once held a local gate for almost
  half an hour
  (`research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#stop-a-program-that-never-finishes`).
  The runtime group's C harnesses, which `compiler/Makefile` builds and
  runs, have only the command's 30-minute deadline. Clippy's
  `disallowed_methods` in a `compiler/clippy.toml` could refuse
  those three methods, with an `#[allow]` at each call of the host C
  compiler, `grep` or `awk` in the tests and at the driver's own calls of
  the host toolchain. Validate that the lint fails on a restored
  `Command::output` of a test program. Reopen when a new test program run
  bypasses the owned process, or when the tests' process calls are next
  reorganized.

- **The design-tree skill's tests also test this project's CI script.**
  `design/skill/test_lint.py` runs `.github/design-review-base.sh` in nine
  of its cases, so a project that copies `design/skill/` gets failing tests,
  although the skill is meant to move to another project unchanged. Move
  those cases to a `--self-test` of `design-review-base.sh` wired into
  `make static`, as the other `.github` scripts do, and keep only the lint's
  own cases in the skill. Validate that each moved case still fails once for
  its intended reason. Reopen when the skill is extracted or the CI base
  selection changes.
- **Static verification uses inconsistent, mutable comparison refs.** The
  root `spec-archives` target hard-codes local `main`; after a branch integrates
  current upstream, an older local ref can report multiple new archives even
  when the PR changes no specification. Local `design-lint` and
  `design-ready` instead default to the current `origin/main` tip: if it
  advances past the branch's merge base, new upstream nodes can appear as
  branch deletions and trigger missing approval-log coverage in
  `make design-ready`, and an upstream specification amendment makes its
  specification half demand a `spec/log.md` entry the branch does not owe
  (reasoned from the code, not yet observed). The first two were observed on the
  ownership-surface research branch; explicit checks against its actual review
  base retain the intended obligations. Select and report one pinned review
  base consistently with hosted CI. Validate old local main, advancing remote
  main, an integrated branch and a real branch amendment; retain archive
  immutability, version-transition and changed-node coverage checks. Reopen
  when updating verification-base selection. This research uses the existing
  `DESIGN_REVIEW_BASE` override for the actual merge base and records default
  failures; it does not change the checks or another worktree's main ref.
- **The corpus stage waits on one serial conformance walk.** Each of the
  conformance adapter's two walks visits every conformance case on one
  thread, 62 s and 78 s on the four-core container where it was profiled, so
  there the corpus stage cannot drop below about 78 s at any thread count
  while its other 91 cases need about 87 CPU-seconds
  ([serial profile](../research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#where-the-time-goes)).
  Splitting each walk's cases across the processors, keeping every case's
  ordinary compiler path and verdict, would bring that stage near its 57-s
  processor bound; the hosted runners, whose stage takes 51–97 s, are bounded
  the same way. It is not the gate's critical path while the unit job is
  longer; reopen when the corpus job becomes the longest or its budget trips.
  This changes conformance evidence wiring, so the PR states it under
  AGENTS.md rule 4.
- **The Windows io-hosts steps have no time budget.** They run without
  `run-check.pl`, so only their step timeouts (5 and 8 min) and the job's
  (10 min) bound them, and the Windows job is now the longest CI job, 230–285
  s, 171–195 s of it the Rust build and program cases step. Run those steps
  under `run-check.pl` once its process-group handling is shown to work under
  the runner's Git Bash, or wrap them in a small timer that writes the same
  budget record, and give them rows in `.github/time-budgets.txt`. Reopen when
  the Windows job grows past the gate's longest job by a minute or its step
  timeout trips.
- **Incremental rebuilds are not gated.** The time budgets measure hosted
  cold builds, but daily work pays incremental rebuilds, 6–25 s per edit
  today. A change that makes them slow, such as merging modules into one
  large code-generation unit, passes every budget. Measure an edit's
  incremental rebuild in CI or in `make check` if daily rebuilds grow past
  about 30 s; validate that the measurement fails when incremental state is
  discarded.
- **One budget per runner class hides slow growth on faster runners.** On
  identical compiler source the ubuntu `check/unit` stage took 123–187 s,
  so its budget, 1.25 times the slowest run, lets a change grow a fast run by
  about 90% before the stage trips, and the overrun may land on a later
  change's run
  ([budget size](../research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#the-gate)).
  The gate's host record now prints the processor model. If the fast and
  slow runs separate by model, give each model its own budget column, with
  the current one kept for an unknown model, and lower the margin as far as
  the within-model spread allows; validate that a leave-one-out over at
  least seven runs per model trips no build or case stage. Reopen when an
  overrun is traced to a change that earlier runs on faster machines passed,
  or when clippy's variance overruns come more than about once a week.

## firn

- **firn lacks what a deployment needs beyond the benchmark's commands.**
  The owner set this stage's features to the commands `redis-benchmark`'s
  default suite sends ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#the-owners-rulings));
  a server someone deploys in place of Redis needs more. Missing, among
  others: `SET`'s `NX`, `XX`, `GET`, `KEEPTTL`, `EXAT` and `PXAT`, which
  firn answers as a syntax error where Redis sets the key; `SET`'s `EX` and
  `PX` beyond 10^9 seconds or 10^12 milliseconds, which firn refuses as an
  invalid expire time where Redis accepts them, since firn keeps expiries as
  nanoseconds; `CONFIG GET` patterns, which firn does not match, and
  `CONFIG SET`, which firn answers as an unknown option for every parameter
  where Redis sets those it knows; a zero byte in a request's count or
  length line, where Redis's search for the line's carriage return stops at
  the zero byte and waits for more input, answering that the count is too big
  only past 64 KB, while firn answers the malformed line at once; sorted-set
  scores that are not integers below 2^52, which need reading a
  decimal to the nearest double and printing one with 17 significant digits
  exactly;
  quoted arguments in inline commands; a listening address other than the
  loopback and options by name rather than by position; `AUTH`, `SELECT`,
  `KEYS` and `SCAN`, `INFO`, `HELLO` and RESP3, the blocking list commands,
  `MULTI` and `EXEC`, publish and subscribe, a random hash seed, and a
  listener that a restarted server can bind while the stopped one's
  connections wait out TIME_WAIT, which needs the runtime's `tcp_listen` to
  set `SO_REUSEADDR` as Redis does. The owner
  sets the list for the deployment stage; reopen when this stage's
  measurement is handed back.
- **A set never shrinks, so `SPOP` walks ever sparser buckets.** `SPOP`
  picks the first filled bucket from a random position, and a hash map keeps
  its buckets after its members are removed, so after most of a large set is
  popped each pop scans many empty buckets inside the atomic statement;
  Redis shrinks its table as it empties. A library hash map that rebuilds at
  four times its pairs when a removal leaves it under an eighth full was
  measured and refused by its criterion
  ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#list-elements-inline-and-maps-that-shrink-results)):
  `SPOP` at depth 1 gained 14% on two CPUs but only 4% on one, while its p99
  fell to 0.32 and 0.58 of the unshrinking map's. The full suite then left
  `SPOP` at depth 1 on two CPUs at 0.87 of Valkey with I/O threads and 0.94
  of Dragonfly
  ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#the-full-suite-results)).
  Reopen with firn's next performance work after the scaling stage, or when a
  criterion weighs depth-1 tail latency; the change is small
  (`hash_map_rebuild` accepting fewer buckets than it had while they
  outnumber the pairs, and a check after each removal) and would join the
  growth decision of `hash-map-storage` in the design tree.
- **`SPOP` reads the hash map's buckets.** The library has no entry that
  returns a member at random, so firn's `pick_member`
  (`apps/firn/commands/sets.wf`) reads the map's public bucket array and
  matches its slot variants, which ties firn to the library's representation,
  and takes the first filled bucket from a random position, which favors a
  member that follows a run of empty buckets; Redis samples buckets instead.
  A library entry that picks a filled bucket, as uniformly as its layout
  allows, would remove both. Reopen with the library's next hash map change
  or when a second program needs a random member.
