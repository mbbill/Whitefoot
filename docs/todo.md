# Defects and follow-up work

Known defects, capability gaps, unresolved costs, and improvement opportunities
found during design or implementation, including unverified ones. An unverified
opportunity is a validation task: state its expected benefit, uncertainty, and
criterion for deciding whether to pursue it. Entries do not select a design.
Remove an item when its implementation and checks land, or its validation
concludes with a recorded disposition; retain any selected follow-up work here.
Add an item at the end of the section that owns its topic, so parallel branches
rarely insert at the same place.

## Numeric conversions and value evidence

- **Validate matching operation origins across named call arguments.** With
  `let input = 257_u16; let reduced = cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(input);`, a guard
  `reduced == 1_u8` keeps the direct comparison and the fully expanded
  `cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(257_u16) == 1_u8` origin. An ordinary call passing
  `input` to a requirement about `cvt.wrap::<u16, u8>(input)` has a different
  typed tree. Current ENT-3 grants no partial origin expansion; forwarding
  through a parameter or passing the matching literal avoids this boundary.
  Assess whether consistent call-side origin normalization would recover
  useful proofs without enumerating intermediate expansion combinations.
  Require matching aliases, replaced inputs, joins and bounded proof cost;
  any additional accepted route needs its own specification decision. Defer
  from the modular conversion operation, which adds no proof family; reopen
  when a real caller needs this named-value form.

- **Select a total float-to-integer conversion policy.** The
  [conversion study](../research/investigations/numeric-conversions/DESIGN.md#companion-operations-and-explicit-deferrals)
  identifies cumbersome total float-to-integer compositions; rounding into a
  float destination is now `cvt.nearest` [OP-6], which deliberately admits no
  integer destination. A saturating or rounding float-to-integer operation
  needs its own NaN, rounding-direction and saturation choice, including
  nonrepresentable i64 maxima, and `llvm.fptosi.sat` fixes only one of those
  choices. Defer because no concrete consumer has selected the complete
  surface; reopen for a program that converts computed floats to integers
  (pixel coordinates, quantization), and compare source and emitted/native
  behavior before choosing a spelling or claiming an improvement.

- **Validate float and domain evidence through saved Results.** Exact
  conversions extend integer value relations only. A checked result
  with a float endpoint does not transport a domain predicate for its old
  input or a float equality; callers can use the payload or branch on
  `.defined` when the predicate is needed. Extending ENT-5/FN-9 could remove
  repeated validation in a real consumer, but requires typed noninteger value
  identities and guarded goal transport beyond the current numeric context.
  Validate input replacement, copied/replaced Results, joins, loops and proof
  costs without combining independent guards. Defer until such a consumer
  demonstrates the need; remove when a selected evidence rule covers it.

- **Qualify broader proved-range transport to the backend.** The
  [bounded conversion control](../research/investigations/numeric-conversions/DESIGN.md#optimized-helpers)
  removes a residual check when its already-verified entry range is supplied
  as an LLVM assumption. Direct lowering under the bare conversion
  proof solves that conversion case without a general transport family.
  Broader transport may benefit operations outside that family, but needs a
  concrete consumer and a complete retained-evidence-to-target mapping, with
  ordinary value support, mutation and call boundaries preserved. Reopen when
  such a consumer retains measurable work despite checked facts; require a
  matched benefit and unchanged acceptance/behavior before choosing a family.
  Defer from the exact-conversion change, and remove after selection and
  qualification or a documented decision that the candidate brings no benefit.

- **Validate further sharing of dense Result evidence when larger consumers need it.**
  The [cost comparison](../research/investigations/result-proof-transport/DESIGN.md#selected-cost-result)
  still places 32 independent outcomes at about 62 ms and 32 joins at about
  265 ms, versus 22 and 26 ms before value-associated proof transport. A dense
  matrix remains per live value and every surviving context participates in a
  join. Sharing more unchanged ordinary cells may reduce this cost, but the
  benefit and representation complexity remain unmeasured. Require matched
  time/RSS improvement on a larger real consumer, identical acceptance and
  valid retained proofs, and candidate/fallback preservation through support
  kills and joins. Defer a broader storage change because numeric-core reuse
  meets the recorded real-program and scale targets; reopen when more live
  Results or wider storage support makes this cost material. The language
  extensions below remain a separate question.

## Checker precision and proof cost

- **A direct call result loses its struct invariant at a reference target.**
  For a `nocopy Pair` with private `left` and `right` fields and invariant
  `left == right`, let `make() -> Pair` return `Pair(1, 1)`. A helper
  `update(pair: &Pair)` with `writes(pair)` that executes
  `set pair^ = make(); return unit;` fails FN-9 at its return. Replacing that
  assignment by `let next = make(); set pair^ = move next;` passes, as does
  direct construction into `pair^`. These paired observations are recorded
  in the [Forest investigation](../research/investigations/unique-keys/DESIGN.md#observations-with-the-current-compiler).
  FN-9 and CALL-4 specify publication of result-field relations onto direct
  ordinary-set destinations after target kills. Trace and repair that
  publication for reference destinations; the exact implementation cause is
  not established. This is conservative rejection, not permission to use a
  false invariant. Reopen before borrowed Forest replacement relies on the
  route. Validate direct-set and let-then-set positives, false callee results,
  alias writes and stale destination facts under the existing rules.

- **A length guard on a match binder is not a fact inside a loop that
  writes through it.** Minimal witness: a function matches `held^` as
  `List(items: list)` and, in a `for` loop, pops from `list` under
  `if list^.inner.len > 0_u64`; `deque_pop_front` then refuses [FN-8] for want
  of `values^.inner.len > 0`, although the guard reads exactly that place
  just before the call. The same guard on a parameter discharges it, so firn's
  `pop_items` passes the binder to a helper, `pop_one`, that takes the list as
  a parameter. Find why the binder's place loses the guard fact across the loop's
  writes, likely the fact's place key naming the binder rather than the
  matched field, and add a conformance case that the fixed checker accepts.
  Reopen with the next program that needs the helper.

- **A widening conversion's operand is read as any affine side.**
  [ENT-2] admits `cvt::<S, D>(e)` as a relation term or comparison-origin
  operand only for e a term or constant. [FN-9] relation terms match that:
  `postcondition_relation_datum` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/ensures.rs`
  recurses to a datum. `goal_affine_side` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/goals.rs` instead reads the operand
  as any affine side. Source cannot reach the difference today, because a
  call argument is an atom [GRAM-5] (`cvt::<u32, u64>(x + 1_u32)` does not
  parse), so a written operand is already a term or constant; the recursion
  is sound in any case, since a widening conversion keeps the mathematical
  value. The owner chose on 2026-09-29 to leave it. Narrow the recursion to
  `goal_operand` or widen ENT-2, with a conformance case either way, when a
  change lets a non-term operand reach a conversion.

- **A module check's cost for a library interface still grows with the
  module's functions.** Reading `std::process`'s closure (the `std::io`,
  `std::text`, `std::fs` and `std::process` interfaces) costs a one-function
  module 71.5 million instructions and a 16-function module 121.5 million
  ([library-modules checker costs](../research/investigations/library-modules/DESIGN.md#the-checkers-per-function-costs-after-the-split)).
  The nominal passes no longer contribute: the layout recursion judgment now
  walks the nominal table only after it changed, and postcondition selector
  admission indexes signatures by path. The remaining 50 million
  instructions are resolution's table building and public-closure check
  (`build_tables`, `check_public_closure` in `compiler/src/resolution/engine/`,
  about 25 million), the entailment schedule of the function inventory
  (`analyze_function_inventory` in `compiler/src/semantic/check.rs`, about 11
  million), instantiation-cycle rejection (7 million) and concrete signature
  collection (6 million). Impact: every check of a module that names a
  library module, and every program returning `ExitStatus`, pays per
  function for declarations it does not use. Change: find in each the work
  repeated per function over every declaration or signature of the closure
  and key it by declaration instead. Validate with the same comparison: H16
  at most 1.1 times H1, verdicts unchanged. Reopen when check time limits an
  experiment.

- **Each check still re-parses the fixed prelude.** The earlier
  [library-modules measurements](../research/investigations/library-modules/DESIGN.md#measurements-of-the-implemented-split)
  found 97 percent of a one-function module's parsed bytes in the 24 prelude
  records (4,425 bytes against the module's 105). Arm selection now indexes
  rows by the first token's full membership, and terminal-set iteration visits
  set bits; the
  [matched macOS comparison](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#parser-row-lookup-cleanup)
  reduces a small check's paired median by 12.4 percent, but the prelude is
  still parsed per check. Impact: fixed repeated work in every module check
  and composition. Change: retain its parsing once per process, relocating
  source/token identities because prelude records follow writer records,
  and preserving explicit resource-ceiling accounting. The relocation's
  representation and benefit remain unmeasured. Validate unchanged verdicts,
  derivations, locations and diagnostics across different writer bundles and
  limits, with a matched checking-cost improvement over this indexed baseline.
  Defer the representation change from the row-lookup cleanup; reopen when
  check time limits an experiment.

- **Some ENT-3 sources read no measure operand.** S5/S6 copies, S1
  comparisons, S11 counted captures, every S7 operation row and a checked
  integer row's success payload read an operand the specification calls an
  admitted term or constant through one reader that includes the MSR-1
  measure terms, so `let r = x % src^.len;` establishes
  `r < src^.len`. Other flow readers of the same shape (subscript offset
  terms, S13 index captures, allocation lengths, range-formation operands,
  integer-domain operands, the `Ok` constructor's payload) are unverified;
  affine images already cover some of them. Repair with the same reader, and
  validate it with paired direct and let-bound cases for each source,
  including a write that kills the measure, requiring no other verdict change.
  Deferred from the counted-endpoint and operation-fact repairs, which changed
  only S11's and S7's reading; reopen with the next entailment change or when
  a program needs the direct form.

- **Joined reference proofs lose useful target-relative information.** A
  reference selecting either of two freshly empty Slots cannot establish the
  append precondition from both constructors' facts; captured disjoint ranges
  formed in separate branches also lose their branch-local endpoint images
  at the join. These safe examples are rejected under the current fixed proof
  routes, rather than demonstrating an implementation violation. The
  [bounded query experiment](../research/investigations/consistency-followups/DESIGN.md#reference-joins-and-bounded-proof-precision)
  supports substituting both operands for the same selected alternative, but
  does not yet establish a complete family: current target authority differs
  from the function-wide origin inventory; Boolean and integer-domain consumers
  need uniform normalization; failed-query term registration needs inertness
  evidence; and polynomial work in an explicit target set is not a bound in
  source size. Keep the current rules until those obligations are resolved and
  matching full-origin, stale-capture, query-order and growth controls pass.
  Branch-local range images additionally need target-presence and capture-
  generation information; a plain union of branch images is insufficient.

- **Distinguish resolved formal anchors from holder queries in proof consumers.**
  Some entailment support/overlap consumers pass an already resolved formal
  root back through `PlaceMap::resolve`, which also serves written reference
  holders. After a parameter rebind this can conservatively add its other
  observed targets. Audit these calls before changing their interpretation;
  use entry-anchor/rebound-holder pairs and overlapping controls to establish
  whether separating the APIs recovers useful precision without omitting an
  origin. No incorrect acceptance or measured benefit is established. Defer
  this consumer change to the joined-reference work above; reopen when that
  work establishes point-current target authority or a real proof needs it.

- **Expose a failed callee proof behind an unavailable summary.** A caller
  whose generic callee instance fails an obligation sees only the callee's
  unavailable summary, reported at its own postcondition or invariant, not
  the failed obligation. Both recorded witnesses, the
  [partially concrete reserve probe](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#partially-concrete-reserve-diagnostic)
  (INV-1 at `room` after `priority_queue_make_room<ProbeDue, ceiling>`) and
  a GrowVector wrapper generic only over `ceiling` (FN-9 at its own
  postcondition), turned on an [OP-9] allocation-size obligation of `grow`,
  which v0.87 retired, so they must be re-run before they witness the gap
  again; the conformance case `mod6-pos-grow-vector-boundary` still wraps
  with a wrapper generic over the element type as well. Change: name the
  failed callee obligation and the unavailable summary without changing
  acceptance. Benefit and attribution are unverified; reopen with a current
  witness when improving call-proof reports.

- **Descendant references retain precision opportunities.** A write through a
  widened range can discard its previously established length facts, and
  independent cursors within one descendant cover cannot use suffix spelling
  alone to establish separation. The
  [cursor investigation](../research/investigations/wildcard-path/DESIGN.md)
  records these limits and the current checking-cost qualification. Preserving
  unaffected extent facts or proving a relation between independently selected
  targets could reduce repeated bound proofs and admit more range-edit programs;
  the benefit and a sound representation remain unverified. Defer this work
  because the maintained list/tree/cursor program needs neither extension.
  Reopen when a concrete program needs that precision. Validate the proposed
  gain with positive editing cases, ancestor/window/stale-capture negative
  controls and the investigation's checking-cost criterion; do not equate
  targets merely because their covers agree. Close this item when the gain is
  implemented and qualified or the measured tradeoff supports declining it.

- **Pair-scoped parallel proofs need scaling and coverage work.** The current
  PAR-1 planner constructs questions for every ordered source pair in a segment
  and retains range separation only for that pair's first-statement state;
  repeated visits meet with logical AND. A segment of n members has n(n-1)/2
  pairs, but that logical requirement does not mandate quadratic repeated
  proof work. General index mapping through the first member's `ensures` is
  still unavailable; missing evidence keeps sequential lowering. For windows
  this means every [WIN-2] part-relative separation is refused when a member
  before the later one writes that window's `len`, which also refuses a read
  of an old slot after an append; the mapping would recover it. A cheaper
  recovery needs no mapping: a place reached through a reference live at the
  first statement's entry is interpreted in that state, and the reference's
  validity gives `i < len` there, so WIN-2's single-state separation still
  holds. That recovers the one pair this rule newly denies in the maintained
  programs, `deque_push_back` against `let first_after_append =
  original_first^` at `tests/programs/containers/deque-program.wf:113`.
  The ledger's denial should also name the length change as its cause; it
  currently reports only the overlapping write and read. Investigate
  indexing and reuse without losing statement identity, captured endpoints,
  flow context or all-pairs composition. Close this item when larger segments
  have measured costs and the intended proof coverage, retaining guarded,
  nonadjacent and stale-capture negative controls.

- **Large entering proof contexts still have substantial checking cost.**
  In the [post-x1 comparison](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#post-x1-selection),
  256 independent inequality pairs with 256 uses still take a median 2.337 s;
  the same context with only three uses takes 0.264 s. Reusing the ordered
  affine index within a certificate removes repeated premise preparation,
  but complete matrix/index construction and long-target AUTO traversal
  remain. This is not certificate-length cost alone: a fixed three-pair
  context admits all 4096 uses in 377 ms. The 512-pair context was accepted
  in exploratory runs; these results establish neither linear total cost
  nor a universal cost for the full use ceiling.
  Preserve the complete [ENT-6]/[PRF-1] rules when investigating that cost.

- **Ordinary-fallback views still copy a fact state per materialization.**
  The [current comparison](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#post-x1-selection)
  checks `tests/programs/fixed_run_library.wf` in 134 ms and
  `tests/programs/wfgrep.wf` in 834 ms. In `materialize_closure_at` in
  [`semantic/entailment/state.rs`](../compiler/src/semantic/entailment/state.rs):
  whenever a selected proof depends on a postcondition call, it clones the
  state, removes the call-dependent candidates and closes that view again.
  A [query-only ordinary projection](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/CHECKING-COST.md#ordinary-fallback-attribution-and-candidate)
  passed the transition checks but improved fixed-run only 1.03x and left
  wfgrep unchanged, so it was not retained. Revisit the representation when
  a current workload attributes a substantial share to this path. Kill-time
  edge insertion and derivation interning for recreated cells also remain.

- **Acyclic generic instantiation has no established practical bound.**
  D7's unchanged-argument cycle rule establishes termination while acyclic
  fan-out may still require exponentially many instances relative to written
  source. The owner deferred this question in D7, whereas the current language
  design rules out exponential checking work. The
  [behavior investigation](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/BEHAVIOR.md#shared-semantic-boundary-and-exact-deltas)
  records the accepted 1343-byte / 2047-instance witness, same-instance controls,
  stage measurements and unresolved correspondence finding. No budget, timeout, new
  source refusal, or measured asymptotic guarantee has been selected.
  Reopen when generic container/behavior composition makes instance count or
  checking cost material. Recheck the distinct-instance and repeated-instance
  controls on that composition, separating semantic checking, lowering and
  emitted-code size; faster duplicate lookup alone cannot close the bound.
  The broader admission or sharing question remains deferred to an explicit
  choice supported by those controls and a complexity argument.

- **Acceptance and check removal are trusted to the whole checker.** Every
  lowering authorization (a subscript without a check, an exact operation, a
  discharged call goal) is issued by the same entailment engine that decides
  acceptance, so the trusted base for "no unproved partial operation" is the
  full front end plus entailment. The
  [certificate packet](../research/investigations/proof-certificate-architecture/PACKET.md)
  (v0.26, before the x1 ownership redesign) selects a staged route: the engine
  records a positive derivation for every discharged obligation, and a small
  verifier over a trusted proof-flow extraction checks them and jointly issues
  the lowering capability, while rejections stay with the engine because a
  missing certificate does not prove non-derivability. The compiler keeps a
  derivation ledger; no verifier, extraction boundary or joint issuer exists.
  Re-derive the packet's Envelope B against the current specification, then
  prototype the verifier on `tests/programs/` and measure its size, proof size
  and added compile time; a corrupted or missing certificate must never
  authorize lowering. Close when a verifier jointly issues the capability, or
  when the packet's stop gates record why the unified engine remains.

- **Write kills do not submit their own OWN-7 separations.** An ENT-5 write
  kill decides an index or range step against a fact's support only from the
  separations already retained on the current edge, which are the EFF-5
  pairwise and REF-2 preservation questions the structural checker submitted,
  plus literal index inequality. OWN-7 makes two ranges disjoint whenever the
  current ProofContext proves one of its four orderings, so a length fact over
  `head^[0_u64]` with `head = &rows[0_u64..1_u64]` should survive a write
  through `rows[1_u64..3_u64]`, bound or formed at the call; today it dies and
  the dependent subscript is rejected, and binding offsets proved distinct
  only by a guard behave the same way. The effect is over-rejection, never an
  unsound acceptance. Submitting one bounded question per written/support step
  pair at each kill would admit these programs at a proof cost per fact per
  write; a literal-endpoint range shortcut beside the literal index one would
  cover constant ranges cheaply. Validate with the bound and inline spellings,
  stale-capture and joined-origin negative controls, and a measured
  checking-cost comparison. Reopen when a real program needs a fact to survive
  a provably disjoint write; close when kill-time separation is implemented and
  qualified or declined on measured cost.

- **Call-argument consumers resolve through the function-wide origin
  inventory.** The entailment flow (`argument_referents`), the permission
  judgments (`argument_places`) and the place map now read one exhaustive
  classification of how an expression names caller storage (`named_place` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/places.rs`), so a new argument form can no longer be
  missed by one consumer; dropping its range-formation arm fails five tests
  across kills, permission and loop permission. They still resolve that place
  through the function-wide origin inventory, and permission substitutes
  unknown values for a row's index and range positions, while the structural
  checker holds each actual's point-current paths and its exact substituted
  row. `design/compiler/checker-facts.md` records the inventory as an
  over-approximation, not point-current authority, so reading the checker's
  facts instead could narrow kills and widen permissions: an acceptance and
  actualization change, not a refactor. Measure how often the two
  resolutions differ at calls on the corpus, and what verdicts and
  permissions change, before proposing it; reopen when a consumer's precision
  blocks a program or an experiment, and close when that comparison is made
  and the owner rules on it.

- **Rules recognized by spelling or implemented twice.** The checker's
  operand-row table (`compiler/src/semantic/check/generics/operands.rs`)
  recognizes the OP-10, OP-11 and OP-14 rows by their prelude spelling, and
  an OP-14 record takes its rule from it; the backend recognizes OP-11's row
  by symbol spelling (`compiler/src/backend/emitter.rs`). Both hold only
  because TYPE-6 refuses a source callable that collides with a prelude
  function; a source value may share a prelude function's spelling since
  v0.86, and no value is a callee. CALL-6's consistency check keeps its own closure
  (`compiler/src/semantic/check/publication.rs`) beside the ENT-4 closure the
  specification names, and INV-1 affine formation and call-goal images are
  each formed in both the checker and the flow.
  Select by PRE-1 operation identity, route CALL-6 through an isolated
  ordinary query, and form each image once. Validate with identical verdicts
  and a prelude-spelled source declaration that still reaches neither path.
  Reopen when a prelude collision rule changes.

- **Most repairs outside the goal families have no pinned pair.**
  `compiler/diagnostic-repairs` pins every repair with its rejected source
  and a program for each alternative, and keeps the words in one module;
  `driver::pinned_repairs` covers goal and effect rejections as well as
  selected formation and ownership refusals, while many sites across the
  checker that print a fixed repair sentence have no pair. Among
  them are TYPE-2's "build it with a construction function [OP-13]" for a
  storage shape or a cell, OWN-1's "write `move p` for the affine place" and
  "use the copy place without `move`", TYPE-9's inline-shape repair, and
  EFF-5's "these two entries of the callee's row
  may reach overlapping places through one argument", whose pair v0.74
  accepts now that an index and a range can be proved apart: every pair of
  one argument's declared paths a call compares now has a position to
  prove, so only a joined argument naming two places still reaches it. Some cannot be carried out as written: TYPE-9's
  inline-shape fallback sentence offers a constant-capacity form for
  `Segments<T>`, which has none [TYPE-9]; its reachability is unverified.
  A direct `Segments<u64>` parameter instead reaches TYPE-9's type mismatch
  with no repair (`type9-neg-segments-parameter`), although the rule requires
  one. Audit the inline-placement rejection paths, offer only wrapping in a
  `Box` for segments, and pin each reachable repair when revisiting those
  diagnostics.
  PROV-6's partial-consume repair writes the
  placeholder `let N(f: a, ...) = move v;`. PROV-6's LinearValueNotConsumed
  offers that placeholder as its second route for every linear binding,
  although an opaque host handle such as `ReadFile` cannot be taken apart
  [TYPE-2], an enum is taken apart by an own-place `match` [OWN-13], and a
  value of an unbounded type parameter can only be moved whole; the
  [beyond-memory article](articles/beyond-memory.md) shows it for
  `ReadFile`. TYPE-11's TypeInvariantWritableField repair is unpinned too:
  a `public` field is written only in an interface record, which a
  single-source pair cannot hold, so pinning it needs a module-form pair;
  and FN-9's propagated-exit repair is pinned for a refuted relation only,
  its unproved sentence still unpinned.
  The generic HashMap atomic-update attempt also reaches
  `LinearAssignmentTarget` with "take the linear value out and consume it
  before writing this place" (`semantic/check/expressions.rs`), although
  WIN-3 forbids taking an element out of a window slot. Offer a valid
  whole-value exchange with `swap` where applicable, rather than a hole;
  pin a linear-slot rejection and its accepted repaired program when this
  repair is revisited.
  Pin each with a program per
  alternative, rewording those that fail, and move the sentences into
  `check/repairs.rs`; validate by the pair test. Found in the review of the
  opaque-struct repair; reopen with the next diagnostics change or when an
  agent follows an unpinned repair that fails.

- **A cell taken apart with no binder is repaired by removing the
  statement, even when its content is linear.** TYPE-2's repair for
  `let Box(..) = move cell;` is "remove this statement", and so is the
  repair for a binder over a place the checker cannot type as a cell. With
  a linear content the removal leaves the cell to PROV-6's
  LinearValueNotConsumed at scope exit, and with a binder its uses become
  unresolved. DIAG-1 holds, since the refused judgment succeeds and the
  later ones judge the program's own statements, but a repair that moves
  the content out (`let content = move cell.inner;`) or names
  `free_empty` for a runtime-capacity content would save a round. Validate
  with a pinned pair for each; reopen when an agent is seen needing that
  round.

- **Four design nodes keep wording that later changes moved past.**
  `language/ownership/copy-classification`'s second decision still says the
  prelude declares `Box`, `Slots`, `Ring` and the fourteen host handles
  `nocopy` or `nodrop`, although the host handles moved to the standard
  library's host modules (the specification's OWN-1 already says so).
  `language/system-interface/opaque-scalar-types` calls `exit_status` and
  `socket_address_v4` construction functions, the term
  `language/data-model/opaque-struct` now keeps for OP-13's rows, and
  opaque-struct's third decision still names "the separate system
  declaration domain the prelude is deliberately not" where the refused
  domain concerns the standard library's host declarations too.
  `compiler/diagnostic-repairs`' fourth decision places the pairs in the
  pinned-sentence corpus, which now lives in `driver::pinned_repairs`. Each
  needs an amendment and the owner's ruling; found in the second review of
  the opaque-struct repair; reopen with the next change to any of these
  nodes.

- **A field of a program's opaque struct cannot be read.** TYPE-2 says an
  opaque struct's fields obey the ordinary field, ownership and release
  rules, but the checker gives a source opaque struct the fieldless
  `CheckedNominalKind::Opaque` (`compiler/src/semantic/model.rs`), so
  `token.value` and `token^.value` on a parameter of a program's
  `opaque struct Token { value: u64; }` are rejected with TYPE-5. No value of
  such a struct is ever formed, so only functions no call can reach with a
  value are refused, and host handles have no fields. Give the kind its
  declared fields for reads, writes and moves out; validate with an accepted
  read, write and move out on such a parameter. Found in the review of the
  opaque-struct repair; reopen when a program has a reason to declare an
  opaque struct with fields, or with the next change to nominal kinds.

- **Attribute cold wfgrep compiler memory before changing its representation.**
  The [module-product qualification](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#final-current-main-qualification)
  observes compiler-only peak RSS of 364.61 MiB on matched main and 377.62 MiB
  on the candidate. Most of this footprint predates retained module products;
  its allocation sources and reducible share are unverified. Profile live
  allocations by checking phase, then require a same-source reduction with
  unchanged verdicts and LLVM before selecting a representation change.
  Defer from entry-edit latency work because these are cold-build observations
  without causal attribution. Reopen when larger inputs or concurrent
  compilation make the footprint limiting; remove after attribution and an
  implemented or explicitly declined response.
- **An instantiated goal spells a field-read range endpoint as `?`.** An
  FN-8 goal over a range an argument formed at the call renders an endpoint
  that is not a literal, const or binding as `?`, as in
  `text^[?..?].len <= 16_u64` for `&text^[span.start..span.end]`, because the
  entailment renderer has no source text for such a capture. The repair
  already spells those endpoints from their source occurrence and says to
  copy them into bindings; the `instantiated_goal` payload does not. Spell
  the capture's source occurrence there too, through the same occurrence the
  repair reads, and pin it with the field-endpoint pair in
  `driver::pinned_repairs`. Reopen with the next change to goal rendering.
- **An affine bound is lost at a statement join where the binding's images
  differ.** After a scan whose `pos <= length` is known only as an affine
  invariant conclusion, `let result = pos; if result < start { set result = start; }`
  cannot prove `result <= length`, although each edge satisfies it: the
  then edge holds it in L0, the false edge only as an affine theorem, the L0
  join drops it and [ENT-6] gives `result` a fresh atom. No local invariant
  carries it, because the two edges' conclusions are different canonical
  inequalities. The
  [witness](../research/investigations/writer-lost-facts/DESIGN.md#shape-6-lockstep-arrays-and-struct-fields)
  is the limit PR #169 records for lockstep counters. Impact: writers keep
  both clamps or must add a header relation that makes the branch dead.
  Candidate: at a join input, project a two-atom affine conclusion over two
  live bindings' current images into L0 before the join; validate soundness
  against replacement and alias controls and measure closure cost first.
  Reopen when a consumer cannot avoid the branch.
- **A struct-field operand of a product or subtraction is not proved.** [ENT-6]
  gives affine value images to live own integer bindings and measures only,
  and its interval product needs both operands' images, so after
  `propagate parse_header(...)` publishes `header.width <= 16384_u32` and
  `header.height <= 16384_u32`, `let stride = header.width * 4_u32;` is
  proved but `stride * header.height` is not, and neither is a product whose
  operand was computed from a field; copying the fields into bindings first
  proves both. The same holds for a parameter's fields bounded by `requires`,
  so it predates v0.80, but v0.80's field relations make it the next thing a
  writer meets: PR #169's probe p2a predicted exit 24 and is refused at that
  product. A subtraction shows the same pattern: with
  `struct Span { start: u64; end: u64; }`, `span.end - span.start` stays
  [OP-2] Unproved (residual `span.end -defined span.start`) under
  `requires span.start <= span.end` on a by-value parameter, at 290b575b and
  f5024250, and at f5024250 also under that requirement on a `&Span`
  parameter, inside `if span.start <= span.end` on a local, and under the
  v0.82 struct invariant `span.start <= span.end` on a by-value parameter;
  copying the fields into bindings first proves each. [ENT-2] clause (a)
  makes the field places terms; where the subtraction's proof loses them is
  not yet located. Impact: one `let` per field before a nonlinear product
  or such a subtraction, and a struct invariant alone does not discharge a
  subtraction of the fields it orders. Candidate: give a tracked field place
  the current-value image its binding copy would have, killed with the
  field; validate against field writes, whole-value replacement and aliases,
  and measure closure cost; check that it also discharges the subtraction.
  Reopen when a program cannot copy the field, or with the next change to
  struct invariants.

- **An opaque struct's capabilities ignore its fields.** The checker gives
  every opaque struct a module declares the field-less host representation
  (`CheckedNominalKind::Opaque`), whose capabilities come from its modifiers
  alone, while [TYPE-2] and [PROV-6] give an opaque struct the capabilities
  its fields give it: `opaque struct Holder { item: Box<u8>; }` without a
  modifier is copy to the checker and affine to the specification. No such
  struct has a value [TYPE-2], so the gap shows only in a generic bound or a
  second use checked against a declared type, and `Instant`, the one opaque
  struct with a field, has a copy field and no modifier, where the two agree.
  Its layout is also the 32-byte host representation rather than its fields'.
  Give an opaque struct with fields the ordinary struct kind with a refused
  constructor. The same representation cites the wrong rule for `Instant`'s
  field: `instant.ticks` is rejected as TYPE-5, "expected a source struct",
  where [TYPE-2] makes the field private to a module with no implementation
  record [MOD-6], and destructuring an `Instant` reaches a repair sentence
  no conformance case covers. Validate with conformance cases that pass such
  a struct where `T: copy` is required and use it twice, both rejected, that
  read `instant.ticks` and are rejected citing MOD-6, and that destructure an
  `Instant` and are rejected citing TYPE-2 with its repair, with `Instant`
  otherwise unchanged. Reopen with the next change to opaque structs or
  `std::time`.

- **The container inventory's comments predate Segments.**
  `compiler/src/resolution/kernel.rs` describes `ContainerShape` as three
  storage shapes and a cell and `ContainerNominal::shape` as one of four,
  although the enum includes `Segments`; `DeclarationMeta::container` in
  `compiler/src/resolution/engine.rs` repeats the four-shape inventory.
  This misstates the inventory for a
  reader adding a consumer. Update those descriptions when the nominal
  inventory is next edited; the storage-destructuring repair uses its actual
  identities and needs no inventory change.

- **Direct returns can require an intermediate result binding.**
  The growth-append comparison wrapper's `return grow_vector_append::<T,
  8193>(values: values, value: move value);` cannot discharge an ensures
  relating its returned length to the mutated vector under the current FN-9
  return-datum boundary; naming the call result and returning that name works
  with identical contracts. The paired direct/bound-return tests in
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/postconditions.rs` already cover this boundary.
  The cached-reciprocal HashMap trial exposes the arithmetic form: a function
  `remainder(hash: u64, count: u64) -> index: u64` with `requires count > 0_u64`
  and `ensures index < count` rejects `return hash % count;` with
  `FN-9 InvalidPostconditionReturn`. FN-9 requires the selected returned datum
  to denote an ENT-2 term or constant; the arithmetic expression is neither.
  `let exact = hash % count; return exact;` instead supplies a tracked place,
  with the unsigned remainder bound established at its binding by ENT-3.S7.
  This is the specified return-datum boundary, not a demonstrated compiler bug.
  Impact: ordinary forwarding wrappers and direct arithmetic returns require
  an extra source binding; the optimized append example retains no extra work.
  Reopen with return-contract ergonomics, compare direct and bound call and
  arithmetic forms including refuted and recursive contracts, and decide
  whether a broader return datum is warranted. Any expansion of accepted source
  needs a specification decision; do not change that boundary as part of the
  container timing experiment.

- **Data only proofs read is computed, stored and passed at run time.** A
  range requirement can only name what the callee receives, so
  `cascade_level` in
  `tests/conformance/cases/range5-pos-level-cascade.wf` takes `positions`,
  `depths` and `level` only for its requirements, and its caller computes
  `positions`, one `u64` per element, only to pass it; Snowghost's style
  stage at `8b4f332` does the same. Impact: an allocation, a store per
  element and five machine arguments per level, bounded below 1% of
  Snowghost's sequential style stage on two pages
  ([proof-only data](../research/investigations/proof-only-data/DESIGN.md#measurement)).
  Change: a whole-program pass that removes what no executable statement
  reads once proofs are erased, a least fixed point over dead parameters,
  fields, stores and allocations that keeps calls and uncounted loops and
  the entry, callback, host and module-public boundaries. Validate with
  compiler tests pinning both witnesses' emitted code free of the data, and
  by timing the program that reopened the item. Reopen with a program whose
  profile puts such data on its critical path.

## Containers and storage lowering

- **Check measure-fact transport when wrapping a runtime-content Box.** A new
  append fallback fixture constructs `inner = box_slots_new::<u64>(capacity:
  4_u64)`, then `outer = box_new::<Box<Slots<u64>>>(value: move inner)`. Calling
  a helper requiring `outer^.inner.inner.len == 0_u64` is rejected at FN-8 by
  frozen compiler `f99bd0bb2bb51fa09c5ea8c09fcb0e029bfc309e`. The rejection
  alone does not establish a language gap: determine whether the current
  rules transport the constructor fact automatically or need an explicit proof,
  and fix the implementation if that specified path is missing. Reopen with
  nested-owner fact transport; qualify zero length and preserved capacity after
  wrapping, with a nonempty negative. The append optimization's outer-Box
  fallback test checks IR selection only; it does not claim this constructor
  chain executes. No runtime guard or changed verdict substitutes for that gap.

- **Readonly storage measures cannot yet be passed by reference.** TYPE-2,
  OP-15, PRE-1 and REF-1 describe ordinary readonly fields and field-reference
  paths, but the compiler's borrow-place selection rejects this minimal program:

  ```wf
  fn read_word(word: &u64) -> value: u64 reads(word) {
    return word^;
  }
  fn main() -> status: std::process::ExitStatus pure {
    let values = box_slots_new::<u64>(capacity: 1_u64);
    let length = read_word(word: &values.inner.len);
    return std::process::exit_status(code: 0_u8);
  }
  ```

  The frozen `f99bd0bb2bb51fa09c5ea8c09fcb0e029bfc309e` compiler rejects
  `.len` with TYPE-5, expecting a source struct and finding `Slots<u64>`;
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions/places.rs` takes the ordinary
  field-rejection path instead of resolving the declared measure. This is a
  compiler/specification discrepancy, not an alias guarantee for optimization.
  Reopen with measure-reference support: resolve these readonly fields through
  the ordinary reference path, preserve readonly effects and reference validity,
  and qualify both stored runtime measures and omitted constant measures.
  Add an executing positive for this program and observations across permitted
  writes, plus negative writes through readonly references. The current append
  work uses a container-reference observer and retains conservative alias rules;
  it does not repair or redefine measure references.

- **Window-length selection repeats helper-graph analysis.** The append-path
  discovery and scalar-only check in
  `compiler/src/lowering/window_length_residency.rs` stop recursive cycles but
  revisit shared acyclic callees for each incoming call. A layered shared-call
  graph can therefore multiply lowering work without increasing program size
  proportionally. Reuse completed per-function summaries, distinguishing a
  complete result from a recursion-cut partial result; keep helper-version keys
  relative to the selected path and roll back unsuccessful versions. Reopen
  when admitting additional helper shapes or when compiler phase measurements
  expose repeated traversal. Validate on a shared-call graph with an independent
  visit-count bound, alongside unchanged generated behavior; the current small
  append program's emission time does not qualify larger helper graphs.

- **A hash map offers no sample or bounded visit.**
  `std::collections::hash_map` visits every pair (`hash_map_each`) and
  nothing less, so a program that must look at a few pairs at a time, as
  Redis samples keys with an expiry, either scans the whole map inside one
  atomic statement, holding every other context for the scan, or keeps a
  second structure beside it: the Redis subset keeps a priority queue of
  expiries, one entry per expiry set, including those a later command
  replaced (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`,
  Experiment 8). A visit that starts at a position and returns the position
  the next visit resumes at would express sampling and incremental scans,
  as Redis's `SCAN`. Validate with a `SCAN`-style program over a map that
  changes between visits, every pair present throughout reported at least
  once. Reopen when a program must walk a shared map without holding it for
  the whole walk.

- **A hash map that removes and inserts at its ceiling fills with vacated
  buckets.** `hash_map_put` never rebuilds a map already at its ceiling
  (`language/data-model/hash-map-storage`), so a map that churns there, a
  bounded cache that evicts one key to admit another, keeps every bucket a
  removal vacated until the program calls `hash_map_rehash`; once no bucket is
  left vacant, every lookup of an absent key and every insertion probes the
  whole backing. Rebuilding at the same capacity when few buckets are filled,
  as below the ceiling, would clear them only for a map with fewer than three
  eighths of its buckets filled and would allocate a second backing at the
  ceiling; an in-place rehash that permutes the backing, the rebuild the node
  refuses as the default, clears them without one. Measure a map held at its
  ceiling under steady removal and insertion, probes per lookup of an absent
  key over time, with and without an automatic rehash, before choosing. Reopen
  with a program whose map churns at its ceiling.

- **Validate a shared Ring wrap calculation independent of layout bounds.**
  The corrected front predecessor handles every admitted capacity. Remaining
  address-only modular additions are justified by the positive-stride target
  bound or the zero-stride address operand; head advancement separately uses
  the safe offset one. An overflow-free common formulation could simplify
  those grounds across indexed access, shifts, transfers and cleanup, at the
  cost of more emitted arithmetic. Compare exact coordinates at u64 boundaries
  and representative native cost before selecting it. No remaining observable
  defect is established; defer beyond the predecessor repair and reopen when
  changing Ring layout or coordinate consumers.

- **Ordered Vector consumption still relocates rear elements.** The take-first
  composition exchanges an owned local with each first-half suffix slot, then
  consumes the reversed remainder. It preserves the prefix and callback order
  with O(removed) work and constant auxiliary storage, but still relocates
  `floor(removed / 2)` rear elements beyond a direct consumer's handoffs. The
  [matched native comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md)
  separates that source cost from redundant compiler snapshots; qualified
  independent stack slots and descriptor-before-transfer takes remove the
  latter in the local Clang 21 retained-record witness. That result establishes
  neither a guarantee across optimizers nor universal native parity. Keep the
  current ordinary composition while measuring any
  concrete workload that makes its remaining movement significant; introducing
  a more general operation without that evidence is deferred. Reopen before
  relying on ordered consumption in a performance-critical container. Compare
  an alternative under the same original-order, disjoint-callback,
  nodrop-ownership, constant-auxiliary-space and O(removed) contract, including
  nearly complete retention; require an attributable measured improvement
  against direct C and the current WF implementation. No new language operation
  is selected yet.

  A separate implementation possibility is a checked-IR rewrite of the
  complete take/swap permutation into forward owned consumption, with ordinary
  lowering for unmatched regions. EFF-5 callback separation and STOR-7
  relocation support that question but do not prove the rewrite: an extra
  backing read or partial-progress return can observe the displaced rear
  owner and must prevent selection. Preserve callback, release and divergence
  order, prefix/capacity, arbitrary linear elements and target qualification.
  Validate a fixed permutation-equivalence argument, structural positive and
  negative witnesses, owning cleanup and same-source timing before adopting a
  recognizer. No semantic impossibility or new primitive follows from the
  current native gap. A conservative recognizer is now implemented on the
  work branch under a pending amendment. Its
  [actual-compiler factor isolation](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#actual-compiler-factor-isolation-after-ownership-integration)
  finds useful traversal gains but adverse wide suffix-one medians and strict
  wide empty-control losses; ordinary function-actual hints produce identical
  native code in both traversal settings. Keep this item open for the
  remaining traversal/controller and code-placement costs. The remaining-count
  spelling was rejected by its native-code screen; open constructor-constant
  setup and digest-handoff leads are recorded under short Vector cycles below.
  The subsequent [ordinary controller composition](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#ordinary-controller-composition-scalar-suffix-three-losses-prevent-selection)
  passes complete correctness and release checks but regresses scalar suffix-3
  at all three populations, so its four useful gains do not select that
  source rewrite. The separately qualified
  [countdown batch controller](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#countdown-batch-controller-balanced-pair-selects-caller-composition)
  changes that outer live-state dataflow, recovers the original scalar cycle
  count and passes the full balanced no-loss screen with three scalar
  suffix-two gains. Only this caller composition is selected; the baseline
  scalar tail already inlines, and neither result justifies a uniform hint.
  The recognizer's
  existence neither settles that performance tradeoff nor justifies extending
  its equivalence domain.

  The owner withdrew uniform function-actual hints after their claimed current
  benefit failed the [actual-compiler comparison](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/BEHAVIOR.md#ordinary-inlining-hints-for-supplied-functions).
  The old callback threshold effect belongs to a combined raw-LLVM artifact;
  it is not evidence for the removed heuristic. Reopen only with a real
  consumer that separates hinted and unhinted native code and passes matched
  performance checks. Terminal traversal's separate costs remain open.

- **Empty-Slots allocation removal needs complete ownership and ABI coverage.**
  The inline-owner zero-extent representation now under evaluation differs
  from these shared-header prototypes: metadata remains per owner, and
  positive capacity times qualified stride is the uniform allocation
  boundary, including ordinary linked bodies. Its required closure evidence
  is explicit, implicit, nested and worker cleanup, empty owner transport,
  growth from zero and cleared positive owners, followed by matched API
  timings. Do not infer that evidence from an earlier prototype.
  The unselected [zero-capacity candidate](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#zero-capacity-slots-sentinel-complete-samples-selection-unresolved)
  changes explicit growth and empty release, but its patch does not change
  derived Box cleanup's ordinary `FreePointer` path. A shared header must
  never reach an allocator release through implicit scope cleanup. The
  [read-only ownership/native audit](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#empty-storage-native-scope-and-ownership-audit)
  also finds that legal `grow(capacity: 0)` still allocates a heap header which
  the patch's capacity-zero release test skips, while zero-count `append` and
  `split_off` still write length words. These are inspected gaps in the
  unselected patch, not demonstrated defects in the retained compiler.
  Before reopening, cover explicit, implicit and nested cleanup, grow-zero,
  whole-Box replacement/exchange, two independent empty owners, zero-count
  writes and ordinary linked constructors/consumers under one physical ABI.
  Capacity zero is not an allocation-ownership tag. Account for any new
  metadata or runtime checks on positive-capacity hot paths; do not revive the
  old patch.
  A separate [nullable-owner prototype](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#nullable-zero-extent-owner-allocation-gain-useful-regressions-refuse-selection)
  covers the measured Vector owner/linked ABI path and removes the zero
  request, but its full pair has 14 qualified useful losses against four
  gains; repeated scalar reuse roughly doubles. The preregistered no-loss
  condition refuses it. Its immutable READ-only fallback fails the native
  append-promotion/frame screen before behavior or timing. Reopen only with
  a general nonnull hot-path lowering that passes a discriminating native
  screen, then complete real-worker and all-bin lifetime qualification before
  any representation selection.
  The [canonical-header successor](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#canonical-empty-header-tag-balanced-diagnostic-misses-the-growth-criterion)
  restores baseline hot operand streams but fails both trace-frame screens.
  Its balanced measured diagnostic has two suffix-two gains and no qualified
  useful loss; the required growth/16 gain overlaps in both pairs, so the
  primary criterion remains unmet. Its near-C++ growth medians are peer-target
  inconclusive, and inherited `memmove(0)` elision prevents isolated allocation
  attribution. Keep this frozen pre-countdown result separate from selected
  caller gains; reopen only with a materially changed general lowering and
  complete lifetime coverage, not a rerun of this unchanged candidate.
  The surviving native empty allocation/free pair occurs per reserved/growing
  round; optimized reuse/suffix construction already omits it, unlike the
  instrumented ledger. Local fresh-allocation coalescing is an unimplemented
  hypothesis, limited by conditional lifetime and the growing path's surviving
  call boundaries. A new pass is not justified by this benchmark alone.
  A capacity-taking convenience constructor could address reserved setup but
  is absent from the current API and would not fix default growth-16. Defer
  implementation until a complete ordinary consumer and ownership/ABI argument
  justify the scope; the earlier realloc and initial-capacity refusals remain.
  The separate zero-byte growth-copy elision is still unverified and is excluded
  from the spare-capacity append comparison. Reopen it with the reserve/grow
  API: preserve allocation, header initialization, owner replacement and release,
  and distinguish empty scalar storage, nonempty scalar storage and nonempty
  zero-sized elements with an independent copy/release observer. Do not attribute
  its possible benefit to a length-publication or empty-owner change.

- **Deque scalar costs remain after payload-address qualification.** The
  [paired comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  isolates the qualified index fact and reduces normal scalar forward churn
  from about 2.3x C to 1.20–1.26x, leaving that residual gap unattributed.
  Retained scalar reverse churn is about seven percent slower in the new
  production layout despite identical relevant instructions and dependencies.
  A controlled 32-byte padding experiment restores the endpoint addresses
  without reliably removing the difference, so neither endpoint placement
  nor an intrinsic assumption cost is established as its cause. The owner
  selected provisional retention of the fact with both results preserved;
  no measured application mix makes the forward gain cancel the reverse loss.
  Compare the remaining scalar work with the same source, independent oracle
  and C controls, preserving native code/data placement and recording
  execution-state variation before attributing a cost to the interface or
  choosing a production alignment policy. Require repeatable improvement in
  both measurement orders and account for other affected paths. Defer broader
  tuning while this causal question is open; reopen for a workload dominated
  by retained reverse calls, a native-toolchain change or another material
  regression under the matched comparison.

  The fresh [standard-container series](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-practical-timing)
  makes the payload distinction explicit: scalar reverse churn costs
  2.712–2.795 times Rust VecDeque across the measured populations, while
  wide forward/reverse traces stay within ten percent of both native deques.
  At 4096 elements the scalar reverse gap to the source ring-loop C control
  is only 1.172–1.185 times, so the native gap alone cannot select a compiler
  fix. Compare modulo/index handling and the generated churn loop with
  the same ring representation before attributing a share. The wide growth
  trace also exposes allocation-policy tradeoffs: WF makes six requests,
  Rust nine including six reallocations, and C++ 1572, but C++ has the lowest
  requested-byte peak. Preserve those distinctions; this is neither an
  isolated growth-latency result nor a physical-memory measurement.

  The 2026-09-27 emitter fix
  [`5ae2cdd40793e617dbbe88d3fc38681db983166f`](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md#production-lowering-reuse-a-front-placement-slot)
  carries a `place_front` Ring's already computed physical slot into its
  descriptor update. The raw body no longer reloads head/capacity or repeats
  the predecessor calculation; its focused backend test and the complete
  ownership/checksum matrix pass. A matched seven-sample, two-cohort run
  reduces scalar reverse churn from about 1.39--1.41 times C++ to
  0.49--0.50 times, without a useful regression elsewhere. The remaining
  scalar growth traces include rebase's per-element transfer and additional
  appends; this front-placement fix does not explain those costs. Keep a
  same-source bulk-transfer discriminator separate, preserving allocation
  policy and the logical-order oracle before changing the Ring API or
  selecting a new operation.

  The [uniform entry-capacity trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md#entry-capacity-pair-scalar-gains-wide-regression-candidate-rejected)
  is rejected: three scalar growth gains accompany a qualified wide growth
  loss. Removing destination wrapping permits adjacent scalar stores, but
  the wide append instead vectorizes corresponding fields across records
  and shuffles them back into record order, with a larger frame and a seed
  reload. The pair does not apportion those costs. The isolated
  [representation-limited trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md#representation-limited-pair-scalar-gains-historical-target-unresolved)
  preserves aggregate control instructions and obtains three scalar growth
  gains, including both required populations, with unchanged semantic and
  120-row accounting observations and no qualified loss in all 24 cells.
  Selection remains pending: the historical scalar forward-churn 256 target
  pass disappears in both current arms, so the original historical-target
  condition is unresolved without a demonstrated candidate-caused loss.
  Keep that condition separate from any prospective final-current-main
  comparison. The SSA-value versus stored-aggregate boundary excludes even
  one-word structs and arrays; its current success is not a profitability
  theorem. Scalar growth 4096 still costs about 1.18 times Rust and 1.30 times
  C++, while growth 256 and both wide growth populations still overlap their
  slower standard peer. Reopen selection on the separately specified current
  comparison or a representation/native-consumer change, and investigate
  remaining transfer and controller costs with the same source and complete
  family controls. The uniform trial's refusal and standard-peer deficits
  remain; no new API or allocation-policy change follows from this pair.

  The [retained native comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md#remaining-margins-and-retained-native-work)
  narrows a next lowering question to the one-step Ring front-removal
  successor: WF still uses the general wrap subtraction in rebase and drain,
  while C uses equality and a shorter conditional increment. The current
  constructor/writer induction preserves `head < cap` at positive capacity,
  but [MSR-2 and PRE-1](../spec/kernel-spec.md) publish only `head <= cap`,
  and the [storage representation](../design/compiler/storage-representation.md)
  and ordinary ABI decisions state no stricter linked-caller obligation.
  PROG-3 permits an ordinary Ring-taking entry; an inventory of today's host
  modules cannot close that boundary. For a zero-size Ring with `len = 1`
  and `cap = head = 1`, the bounded O0/O3 native observer returns head 1;
  an equality-only successor would yield 2 and violate the declared bound.
  Fixed/runtime scalar and zero-size boundary sources pass source checking
  and LLVM emission, as does a closed constructor control. The positive-stride
  boundary exposed a separate correctness defect: TakeFront used the raw head
  as its physical index and returned the initialized one-past guard instead of
  slot zero. The physical-address correction and its
  [ordinary-signature regression](../compiler/src/backend/tests/windows.rs)
  normalize that address without changing the numerical head update. The
  minimal ordinary-call boundary below is not a closed Whitefoot construction
  trace.

  ```wf
  fn main(window: &Ring<Array<u64, 0>, 1>) -> result: u64 writes(window) contract {
    requires window^.len > 0_u64;
    requires window^.head == window^.cap;
  } {
    let value = take_front(window: window);
    return window^.head;
  }
  ```

  Head is observable logical state; zero-stride address normalization changes
  only the physical operand. The current unsigned addition can wrap at a
  maximum-capacity zero-stride Ring, so the positive-stride allocation bound
  is not a proof about that numerical successor. Any shorter successor must
  cover the inclusive head domain and the full zero-stride range under the
  existing OP-10/PRE-1 rules; no source fact or new acceptance path follows
  from the compiler's stronger reachable invariant. Reopen only with that
  equivalence argument and the pending policy comparison resolved, requiring
  scalar native work to decrease without wide shuffle/spill expansion and
  preserving every semantic, accounting and useful-cell control. Defer bulk
  transfer as its separate algorithm/API question, and do not attribute
  elapsed shares from static instruction counts.

- **Slab aggregate results retain extra transfers and layout overhead.**
  The [Slab comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/slab-library/RESULTS.md)
  separates the one-slot cell's extra word from its helper boundary: retained
  wide removal and consumption has three 256-byte transfers in WF versus one
  in C even though both `Option<Record>` results occupy 264 bytes. The separate
  insertion `Result<SlabHandle, Record>` occupied 280 bytes in WF's former
  product layout versus 264 in C's union ABI; the union layout of
  [compiler/payload-enum-layout](../design/compiler/payload-enum-layout.md)
  now makes it 264 bytes, as in C, and leaves `Option<Record>` and the
  transfer counts unchanged. Keep these distinctions when interpreting
  timing; a cell-layout change alone cannot remove these costs. Validate
  forwarding or result placement with
  the same owning return paths, failed insertion returning the offered owner,
  partial cleanup and alias controls, checking optimized transfers and
  same-source timings on supported toolchains. Defer call ABI
  changes until the forwarding experiment establishes which transfer can be
  removed without changing ownership; reopen with the owning-map library or
  a workload dominated by wide Slab removal.
  The [map's exhaustive returned-owner protocol](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  also supplies an ordinary enum alternative to reassess for Slab's extra
  cell word. Its fit and cost for stable slots, generation retirement,
  exhaustion and removal are unverified; compare that full Slab contract
  before replacing the maintained one-slot form. Defer that distinct
  consumer experiment rather than infer a Slab improvement from map timings.

- **PriorityQueue has distinct sift and return-boundary costs.** The
  [complete library comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md)
  measures retained scalar pop/push at 1.510--1.722 times same-algorithm C for
  16/256 elements. In that comparison WF returned push's Result through a
  pointer and cleared its inactive payload; C returns the scalar result in
  registers. The scalar cohort's three-leaf `Result<unit, u64>` now returns in
  registers too ([result-register investigation](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#selection)),
  while the inactive payload is still cleared and the wide cohort keeps its
  destination. The causal shares, and what that change recovered, are
  unmeasured. Normal wide replacement also costs 1.178--1.289 times
  the swap control at those sizes, while retained replacement reverses the
  direction. Separately, wide hole-sift C halves counted movement on large
  complete traces; ordinary WF swaps cannot be credited with that algorithm's
  cost. Validate return placement and initialization with unchanged-source
  compiler variants, the full owning/refusal chains, preserved C controls,
  both cohorts and emitted-code attribution. Investigate the wide replacement
  reversal before choosing an inlining or forwarding change. A general
  improvement must beat control variation without regressing the complete
  matrix; source ownership must remain intact. Defer ABI changes and a new
  storage operation until those discriminators establish their benefit and
  interference obligations; reopen for the indexed heap composition or an
  application dominated by these paths. Do not report universal native parity
  from the large scalar queue results.

  The current-module [standard-container comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md#practical-timing-results)
  measures ordinary O3 after the register-result change; it does not isolate
  that change from the earlier toolchain and trace. In the qualified work-64
  series, wide pop/push costs 2.022–2.315 times Rust BinaryHeap across the
  measured populations. At 4096 elements it costs 1.070–1.096 times swap C
  and 1.827–1.882 times hole C, making sifting movement a useful source
  discriminator. Wide replacement also remains 1.264–1.371 times Rust and
  1.240–1.297 times swap C across populations; C++'s two-repair replacement is
  a distinct algorithm. First compare a justified WF source shape and inspect
  optimized transfers under the same owning contract; do not subtract the
  whole-trace controls to assign a copy or ABI percentage. Preserve both work
  settings because extending churn materially changes setup amortization.

  The [bounded-scratch exchange trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md#fixed-storage-exchange-timing-three-gains-and-six-useful-losses)
  is refused: three useful gains, six losses and fifteen overlaps. Smaller
  scratch retained 416 bytes of exchange traffic, added hot call boundaries,
  and increased replacement's root-exchange operand traffic despite the
  smaller complete frame. Its compiler machinery is withdrawn; generic
  ownership, equal/disjoint, padding and zero-size behavior tests remain.
  Reopen with a distinct ownership or source data flow that removes complete
  transfers while preserving the shared sift and placement-reporting protocol,
  rather than another chunk-size choice. Delayed reverse rotation changes the
  observable indexed reporter order and cannot replace the shared core. The
  owned-element atomic helper rejects a potentially linear T under WIN-3;
  narrowing the owner domain is not a replacement. The ordinary
  [distinct-reference helper](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md#distinct-reference-helper-result-native-movement-gate-failed)
  admits T and exposes the expected noalias fact, but retains the same three
  wide copies and 512 bytes of stack payload traffic, failing its native gate.
  Merely adding that source boundary is therefore insufficient on the tested
  toolchain. Reopen with evidence for eliminating complete transfers while
  preserving generic ownership and immediate resident-position reporting;
  none of these probes selects a language or compiler-rule change.

  The read-only [replacement placement diagnosis](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md#replacement-result-placement-unselected-lowering-diagnosis)
  identifies a separate complete copy from an addressed local owner into its
  already-selected whole result, after the sink. Investigate qualified whole
  addressed-binding result placement, retaining entry capture, independent
  intermediate snapshots and caller-visible reference reads until commit.
  Reopen with the recorded native transfer/frame/call discriminator and
  same/distinct-result, late-alias-read, competing-return and ownership tests;
  retained input/result aliasing may exchange an outgoing copy for an incoming
  capture, so removing the final copy alone is not a performance result.

  A separate, unselected lead is backend promotion of the pending sift value
  while preserving every comparison and position report's order, value and
  index, distinct from the refused deferred or reordered rotation.
  [STOR-7, REF-3/4 and EFF-5](../spec/kernel-spec.md) make addresses
  unobservable, prevent reference escape and separate the callback
  environments' accessed state from queue writes, giving grounds to
  investigate physical residency without changing source acceptance or API.
  Callback-environment disjointness alone is insufficient:
  `priority_queue_child` declares `reads(queue.storage)`. The sink needs a
  verified actual access slice, or ordinary inlining, proving that the
  child's reads are disjoint from the pending slot. Current
  `IrSourceSignature` and `IrSourceCall` retain modes and borrow/allocation
  information but no complete access map. This requires a separate proof
  over the closed CFG and owner flow, beyond result placement.
  The generic owner domain and every ordinary exit's materialization and
  cleanup still need proof; contexts, waits, unknown transport and the CFG
  carrying that owner remain obligations. Lazy capture at the first exchange
  would add no transfers when `k = 0`; `k + 2` instead of `3k` for `k >= 1`
  is only a prospective transfer discriminator, not a measured result or
  selected mechanism. Reopen after the current one-time placement screen.

- **Small results beyond the per-leaf register budget still use a
  destination.** A stored result returns in registers only when its scalar
  leaves fit the x86-64 budget of three integer-class words and two floating
  leaves ([result-register investigation](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#demotion-probe)).
  A 16-byte result with four 32-bit fields, a small byte array and the 32-byte
  opaque `ExitStatus` still pass through memory. So does every result with
  four to eight integer words, or three to eight floating leaves, on AArch64.
  Packing small integer leaves into shared words, or a per-target budget,
  could carry some of these. Either one adds per-target lowering to emitted
  code and to linked definitions. A third floating leaf on x86-64 cannot join
  them: it returns through the x87 stack, which is not bit-exact for signaling
  NaNs. Besides the launcher's `ExitStatus`, the maintained programs keep
  eight surviving calls with four-word results, in `prefix_expression.wf`,
  `owned_link_cursors.wf`, `option_slots.wf` and `containers/ordered.wf`,
  which an AArch64 budget would return in registers
  ([corpus](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#corpus)).
  None is on a measured path, and the benefit is unmeasured. Reopen when a
  maintained program keeps such a call on a measured path. Validate with
  unchanged source and both lowerings compiled. Require the destination
  round trip to disappear without a new demotion, a lost float bit pattern,
  or a regression in the program's timing, on each target that changes.

- **The hash-map `find` stays out of line because its probe loop is
  unrolled first.** In `tests/programs/containers/hashmap.wf`, LLVM fully
  unrolls `find`'s eight-slot probe loop while it optimizes `find` alone.
  When the inliner then reaches `map_trace`, `find` costs 580 against the
  `-O2` threshold of 225 (595 on main), so its seven calls stay out of line,
  as do the three `remove` calls
  ([lowering comparison](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#lowering)).
  In that investigation's rejected merged-returns lowering, the loop was not
  yet unrolled at that point. `find` cost 105 and `remove` 140, both were
  inlined and then peeled, and the hash-map trace ran at 0.601 of main's time
  against 0.956 for the selected lowering. Both lowerings return in
  registers, so the inlining separates them. How much of that gain an
  inlined, fully unrolled `find` keeps is unmeasured, as is whether other
  small container operations with fixed probe loops behave the same way.
  The [2026-09-27 code-only follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/ECOSYSTEM.md#generic-native-pipeline-pilot-completed-negative-result)
  reproduces the delayed-unroll mechanism on current AArch64 Clang 21 O3:
  deferring full unrolling in the first stage lets `find` and `remove` inline,
  and both records ASCII loops survive. Map text grows 78.991% and the
  three-module total 28.793%, failing the preregistered provisional 25%/10%
  selection screens. Those are experiment screens, not owner-approved
  performance ceilings. Fixed-eight map runtime, full-corpus effects and
  production O2 remain unmeasured; the short construction-cost observations
  remain unqualified. A distinct [frozen Vector F runtime diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/ECOSYSTEM.md#frozen-f-runtime-diagnostic-preregistration)
  subsequently found gains and regressions across all original cells. The
  two-stage delayed-unroll form improves wide suffix-1 but regresses wide
  suffix-2/3; ordinary second O3 improves suffix-1 more while regressing small
  scalar cells and wide suffix-3. Single-stage unroll deferral already inlines
  truncate, but retains array loops/stack copies and regresses every wide
  useful cell. These results select no pipeline policy and measure no current
  fixed-eight lookup runtime. They do not replace the historical Clang 18
  x86-64 runtime evidence above.
  Candidate levers: loop metadata on the emitted probe loop that leaves it
  to the late unroll pass, after inlining; an unroll threshold or pass order
  in the pipeline the driver requests that runs full unrolling after the
  inliner; or an inline hint on small container operations, which alone
  raises the threshold only to 325. Each lever changes emitted code for every
  program. Validate on unchanged source against a criterion fixed before
  measuring: `find` and `remove` are inlined into `map_trace`, the
  20,000,000-repetition hash-map trace gains beyond run-to-run variation,
  `.text` across the maintained programs and container bundles stays within
  a stated growth bound, and the maintained paired compute comparison
  passes. Deferred because it is a host inlining-policy question separate
  from the result ABI, with only historical runtime evidence for the fixed
  probe lookup. Reopen when a
  maintained workload's time is dominated by an out-of-line container
  lookup, or when the driver's optimization pipeline is revisited.

- **Indexed small-payload costs with retained boundaries need attribution.**
  The [native-cost record](../research/experiments/container-representation/indexed-library/RESULTS.md#remaining-native-costs)
  puts 4096-record growth/cleanup at 1.354--1.368 times swap C and
  1.392--1.408 times hole C across policies, cohorts and both series. The
  standalone/shared indexed executables are identical, so this is separate
  from the sharing choice. Wide mixed traces instead favor WF. The position
  reporter retains a 32-byte Due snapshot and a separate 16-byte handle
  snapshot in 48 stack bytes; its native frame is 80 bytes versus C's 32.
  Successful insertion also clears a 40-byte result before writing the active
  fields. Both implementations retain the same handle-validity checks; these
  observed snapshots and stores do not establish their elapsed-time shares.
  Validate which snapshots or result stores general compiler handling can
  avoid using unchanged source, matched public boundaries, emitted code,
  complete ownership/expiry oracles and unchanged controls. Preserve callback
  effects and all validity checks; add no container-specific compiler path.
  Defer optimization selection until that discriminator identifies a benefit;
  reopen for a consumer dominated by retained small-record growth or a measured
  toolchain change. No general interface, storage or compiler mechanism is
  selected by these ratios.

- **Short Vector cycles retain unresolved lowering costs.** The paired
  consumption experiment improves the large-record paths but slows the
  16-element scalar reuse chain in both source orders. Ordinary optimization
  also leaves a large WF/direct-C gap in the one-element suffix cycle, where
  neither composition relocates a rear element. Fewer aggregate transfers do
  not explain either cost. Keep this attribution separate from the operation
  choice above: compare the emitted loop, callback and argument code under
  ordinary and retained helpers, preserving the same source contract and
  accounting for the in-binary C controls' variation. A general lowering
  improvement is worthwhile if the short-cycle reduction is reproducible
  without losing the established large-record gain. Defer further tuning until
  that cause is established; reopen for a workload dominated by these cycles.
  The [paired samples and limits](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md)
  are the starting evidence, not a claim of uniform improvement.
  The selected countdown caller now has balanced-order peer-target counts
  19/1/16 and 25/1/10 with every raw sample retained. Scalar growth/16 remains
  the sole candidate deficit, about 1.08–1.09× C++ and 1.10–1.12× Rust; it
  does not reach the changed suffix controller. Reopen that cause next with
  the existing growth body/native allocation evidence and original workload,
  preserving all capacity/growth policies and the refused nullable alternative.
  Wide suffix-one's raw improvements remain paired-instability inconclusive;
  no selected general lowering or isolated digest-cost percentage follows.

  The historical module [Rust/C++ comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-practical-timing)
  reproduces a material gap at ordinary O3: 4096-element scalar reserved/reuse
  traces cost 2.136–2.175 times Rust Vec, and wide one-element suffix cycles
  cost 2.843–2.865 times Rust and 2.714–2.728 times C++ std::vector. The latter
  also costs 2.523–2.554 times the take/swap C control with matching transfer
  order and allocation policy. All useful native comparison cells meet the
  duration and cohort-stability criteria. This supplies a current consumer
  for the existing lowering discriminator; it does not attribute the gap to
  copies or select a new consumption primitive. Compare unchanged-source
  optimized loops, callback boundaries and surviving aggregate transfers
  before choosing a change. Keep the zero-removal overhead control unranked.

  The [frozen wide-tail inspection](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#wide-tail-setup-and-digest-handoff-deferred-discriminators)
  identified per-cycle constructor-constant saves and digest handoff through
  memory. The [native save-placement discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#constructor-save-placement-native-code-discriminator)
  now gives two qualified short-wide-cycle gains while preserving call depth,
  other functions and linked layout. Local instruction placement also changes;
  the result does not isolate stack traffic or select a compiler policy.
  Find a general source/IR/lowering route, then compare its actual generated
  code and cross-program performance; do not ship a benchmark-specific native
  edit. Digest handoff remains a separate unmeasured lead. Reopen it when its
  change can be isolated without compensating spills or changed call depth.
  The [metadata-only growth-edge discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#branch-weight-growth-edge-discriminator-qualified-behavior-timing-inconclusive)
  obtains that seven-save placement through the existing LLVM pipeline and
  passes the complete owner/behavior witness, but its one full pair has no
  qualified useful gain and all three wide suffix-one peer targets remain
  inconclusive. The fixed 2000:1 ratio is no general policy; test a
  type/name-independent cold-growth rule against growth-dense and short-lived
  callers before selecting it. The separate unchanged-IR spill-sinking option
  gives byte-identical native code here.
  The [ordinary spill-splitting screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#ordinary-spill-splitting-unchanged-target-rejected-before-execution)
  changed Apple Clang's actual `speed` default to partition mode at O3, but
  retained all seven saves and identical target MIR/native code. It is rejected
  before correctness or timing; reopening this option requires changed code
  evidence, not another measurement of the same target. A general lowering
  route remains unresolved; this result says nothing about the driver's O2 path.

  The checked-source [reserved-append comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#checked-append-within-reserved-capacity-useful-regressions-prevent-selection)
  removes growth from the proved-capacity suffix path but regresses four useful
  wide cells, so its provisional API and caller edits were restored. Six scalar
  cells improve; all three wide one-element cells are unstable. The wide tail
  now vectorizes across two records, with 32 lane-shuffle instructions, a
  96-byte spill area and unconditional preservation of eight D registers. The
  code change identifies a competing cost, not its isolated timing share.
  Reopen with a loop-scoped discriminator that preserves within-record SIMD,
  other helpers and the full correctness/performance matrix; do not select a
  global no-vectorization policy or a benchmark-specific lowering rule. The
  timed suffix batches contain only one to three records, so this result also
  leaves the API's bulk-append performance unmeasured.

  The [save-placement preflight](../research/experiments/container-representation/ECOSYSTEM.md#next-discriminator-constructor-saves-on-the-growth-edge)
  also finds different inlining and allocation elision in timed and observed
  images. Existing observed ledgers establish their own lifecycle, not the
  timed image's request count. Preserve this distinction in cost attribution;
  reopen measurement of actual optimized allocations before selecting any
  allocation policy on the basis of those ledgers. Whole-matrix post-O3
  accounting is deferred while the narrower native-code discriminator runs.

  Separately, `grow_vector_new` does not publish its returned backing's empty
  length and zero capacity, although CALL-4 admits both owned descendant
  result measures. Adding those guarantees would let callers establish empty
  cleanup without a dynamic length branch; the current
  [module witness](../tests/conformance/cases/mod6-pos-grow-vector-boundary/vec/vector.wf)
  already publishes the nested length through a named returned owner. This is
  a library API opportunity, with no established runtime benefit or missing
  compiler capability. Keep it separate from the direct-capacity constructor
  comparison so unreserved growth's source stays fixed. Reopen afterward with
  a caller that frees the empty result directly, checking the zero length and
  capacity and retaining wrong-contract and stale-write rejection controls.

- **Historical container comparisons need an explicit replay scope.** The
  current-library Slab, Vector, Deque, PriorityQueue and shared Indexed
  harnesses use the compiler's embedded `std::collections` records. The Map
  alternative-representation and Ordered insertion experiments, and Indexed's
  standalone-heap mode, still use retired syntax, flat library paths or pinned
  source overlays. Their dated results remain historical evidence; those
  modes are not current-compiler replay tools. Reopen only when a selected
  representation or insertion comparison needs them: port the complete
  source/overlay/identity path, preserve the original operation and retained
  call-boundary contracts, and run its independent correctness controls before
  new timing. Until then, use the recorded revision for historical replay;
  partial syntax edits would break its pinned source identities without
  establishing a usable current experiment.
  The [indexed first-rise screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/priority-library/RESULTS.md#indexed-repair-reuses-its-first-rise-comparison)
  also finds a concrete shared-Indexed caller mismatch: `indexed-costs.c`
  still passes a 24-byte `Log` with a thin `Words *`, while current WF expects
  a 40-byte `IndexedCostLog` with an inline `Box<Slots<u64>>` descriptor.
  Port that descriptor, its C accesses and accounting together before linking
  or timing; verify both scalar and wide complete traces against the existing
  transcript/owner oracle. Reopen when an indexed operation needs timing;
  the first-rise source candidate currently has no measured speedup.
  The OrderedMap Makefile's `LIBRARY_SOURCE` override also changes only
  prerequisites and recorded identities: the current CLI embeds its `std`
  records, so changing that path does not select a candidate implementation.
  A current source experiment must use a rebuilt CLI or an explicit ordinary
  package containing the selected body, with the same package transport in
  both arms and a baseline code comparison. Otherwise an apparent A/B run can
  silently compile the baseline twice. The drained-node experiment reopens
  this issue; clarify the recipe and prove which source reached emission
  before using an override for performance evidence.

- **Inactive-payload omission has measured optimizer regressions.** The
  destination-construction candidate removes the owning map's 264-byte vacant
  payload clear and its local pending-window clear while preserving active
  fields, descriptors, ownership and the ordinary ABI. The unchanged-source
  [comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#same-source-inactive-storage-lowering-comparison)
  and its reversed replay show wide growth and rehash gains, but normal wide
  replacement regresses by 7.5--9.0 percent after C normalization. Retained
  scalar Slab lookup also regresses. The registered selection criterion is
  not met; fewer stores are not grounds to accept these costs silently.
  In the replacement path, private exchange inlining adds stack temporaries
  and payload transfers; in Slab, a small result becomes separate field
  stores rather than one combined store. Their causal shares remain
  unisolated. The bounded poison-seeded aggregate-store follow-up also failed
  its structural screen: Slab's successful path grows from 23 to 28 native
  instructions, and wide Map put expands arrays into 105 LLVM loads. It was
  stopped before timings. The owner rejected both candidates; production
  retains baseline destination initialization. Reopening needs a distinct
  argument addressing those optimizer losses. Compare the same full matrices,
  null controls and ordinary/retained boundaries; preserve the dirty-storage,
  selected-variant, partial-window, linked-body and parallel cleanup checks.
  Defined dirty-byte fixtures do not establish transport of undefined inactive
  LLVM value fields. Any reopening must cover that distinction, including Bool
  and pointer payloads, nested products/unions, returns and parallel frames,
  while checking active values and exact ownership. An indirect callable ABI
  does not by itself make a product enum a memory-only representation.
  SSA construction and general aggregate forwarding are separate paths, not
  improvements established by this candidate.

- **Mixed-width scalar access can block private aggregate promotion.** A
  mixed i1-store/i8-load optimizer fixture retains an alloca after O3; a
  coherent one-byte emitter prototype promotes it while plain addressed Bool
  still promotes. In the [Map native stop](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#coherent-byte-memory-prototype-native-stop),
  the reached scalar reason scratch disappears, but no additional timed
  mechanism beyond the rejected store-only floor appears; wide instruction
  counts, frames, calls and stack streams stay unchanged. The compiler files
  were restored without prototype timing. Reopen for a consumer with material
  blocked aggregate promotion or a toolchain change relevant to the unresolved
  Map timing; require a discriminating full-workload gain before selection. Check direct, aggregate,
  linked and worker paths, source/ABI behavior and broad transport before
  selecting general lowering; accepted source behavior is unchanged.

- **Consumed aggregate locals can retain an argument snapshot.** An exposed
  mutable local is loaded into an immutable argument snapshot before a consuming
  call. Clang 21 forwards that snapshot in the large-record regression, while
  Apple Clang 15 retains an extra whole-record copy. General forwarding could
  remove that copy independently of the optimizer, but needs a liveness and
  interference argument across the complete argument list and result/input
  reuse. Existing call-result coalescing does not cover a consumer returning
  unit. Defer broadening that path while the frame and descriptor changes are
  qualified; reopen when the retained snapshot materially affects a measured
  workload. Require a before/after transfer and timing comparison plus the
  existing exposed-place, later-argument-write, reentered-block and owned-result
  snapshot controls. The
  [transfer evidence](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#v061-copy-and-consumption-trial)
  separates this opportunity from the library's remaining element relocation.
  The isolated HashMap follow-up found two 256-byte snapshots across
  `hash_map_put` and `hash_map_try_put`: blanket function-entry materialization
  copied each indirect owned parameter while call lowering passed its address. The isolated mutation adapter calls `try_put` directly,
  so its reached path retains only that helper's entry snapshot; `exchange`'s
  raw-IR copy already folds into register capture in the optimized native code.
  Reopen on the insert/replacement API measurements, not the unreached `put`
  wrapper. Forwarding needs complete liveness, interference and result/input
  alias analysis: the incoming content pointer is not writable private storage,
  and refusal must preserve its bytes before an overlapping result is written.
  This requires a general argument, not a HashMap-specific bypass.
  The [fixed-sink atomic slot attempt](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#generic-atomic-slot-update-admission-stop)
  stops at WIN-3: OP-12 covers affine/copy targets, while unbounded `K`/`V`
  leave the generic slot linear under FN-2/PROV-6. This is a specified capability
  boundary; a fixed result sink does not admit that update, and a `drop` bound
  would narrow the supported owner domain. Keep generic replacement work within
  the current rules; reopen the limitation only with ownership-rule work.
  The
  [isolated mutation comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#mutation-running-index-outcome)
  now supplies a measured consumer: 256-byte duplicate replacement still
  trails both Rust and C++ at matched half load. The direct-field swap control
  reduces offered snapshot traffic but regresses wide replacement at small
  capacity and wide churn at both capacities, so it is rejected; fewer copies
  alone do not settle the cost. Attribute the swap's scalar-register/spill
  shape and generic aggregate transfer lowering before changing general entry
  materialization. Any compiler forwarding change must preserve overlapping-result,
  retained input and constant-input cases.
  The [ordinary incoming-backing trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#ordinary-incoming-backing-measured-implementation)
  removes the reached helper's entry copy while keeping source loads and
  exposed/interior snapshots. The final Jump-edge result-write guard passes its
  regression, and final emitted/native benchmark outputs are byte-identical
  to the measured candidate. The original whole-Map adverse hit cells remain
  recorded alongside the longer overlapping replay. Reopen broader forwarding
  only for an independently measured remaining copy with
  complete interference proof. The [offered-input disjointness floor](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#offered-input-disjointness-native-frame-removed-timing-unqualified)
  removes the exchange vector-save frame on audited separate batch storage,
  but its fixed panel has no separated gain and fails unchanged-peer drift.
  Full inline composition reproduces the earlier equivalent payload spills.
  Keep both unselected: ordinary input/result overlap remains supported, and
  any alias variant needs a general interference proof plus qualified timing.
  The [replacement-continuation floor](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#replacement-continuation-placement-gains-and-churn-losses)
  reduces old-word store traffic after O3, but paired replacement gains coexist
  with separated churn losses; the full panel fails. Keep it rejected and the
  churn attribution unresolved. Reopen continuation placement only with a
  general pre-O3 mechanism, complete ownership/result controls and benefit
  across the matched mutation panel, preserving all adverse observations.
  The [tag-directed private-capture floor](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#tag-directed-private-capture-native-pass-timing-unqualified)
  avoids inactive old-slot loads with original cell-before-result write order,
  but its full timing criterion fails scalar spread despite small-wide churn
  gains; overlapping adverse replacement medians remain. The separate
  [borrowed-tag source form](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#borrowed-tag-source-exposure-native-stop)
  is admitted but fails its native frame/spill criterion. Keep both unselected;
  reopen only with general typed capture/overlap proof and qualified full-panel
  benefit, preserving active old values and all adverse observations.
  The [late Pair-field transfer floor](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#late-pair-field-result-construction-native-stop)
  preserves commit-before-result ordering but compiles to identical object bytes;
  changing that final copy alone supplies no native-cost mechanism or timing gain.
  Repeated syntactic-candidate/callee and
  per-parameter liveness walks are an unprofiled analysis-cost opportunity:
  profile representative compilation before sharing or caching those facts.

- **Ordered node construction retains wide transfers.** The
  [ordered-map attribution](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#transfer-and-generated-code-attribution)
  shows field-expanded node-to-Box construction whose timing contribution
  remains unisolated. The
  [selected cleanup rewrite](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#paired-timing-selects-the-cleanup-rewrite)
  removes the exhausted-node 504/4,224-byte copies; fixed-node construction
  and other materialization are the remaining scope here. Validate a bounded
  construction improvement with unchanged ownership outcomes, node allocation
  counts, dirty/quarantined release checks and normal/retained scalar and wide
  comparisons; inspect optimized code to establish which transfers disappear.
  Keep aggregate-result ABI and general argument forwarding under the existing
  Slab and consumed-argument items. Reopen when construction materialization
  remains in a measured split/build path after the selected cleanup change.

  The current-module [native-library series](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#verified-practical-run)
  supplies that consumer without reusing the old ABI timings. At 4096 wide
  pairs, complete construction/cleanup costs 1.71–1.76 times Rust BTreeMap
  and 1.69–1.75 times C++ std::map, while all five wide paths cost only
  1.03–1.13 times the source C control. Reinspect current optimized IR before
  treating the historical node copies as surviving costs. Keep the library's
  node layout and repair policy separate from any compiler transfer fix;
  closeness to source C alone does not assign either a causal percentage.

  The [aggregate-opening comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#aggregate-opening-full-pair-refuses-selection)
  removes wide per-entry shift calls but fails selection on two scalar Ordered
  cells. The [guarded follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#guarded-aggregate-opening-full-matrix-still-refuses-selection)
  also fails its full comparison: Vector has no qualified useful gain, while
  OrderedMap has five gains and three scalar losses. Skipping empty-suffix
  calls is therefore insufficient grounds for this policy. Small positive
  transfers and caller spills remain unpriced. Reopen only with a different
  transfer-cost hypothesis and a discriminating native observation, preserving
  the full family controls rather than selecting a container or observed-winner
  whitelist. Node occupancy and key/child layout remain separate unresolved
  factors for lookup/traversal after these refused shift trials.

- **Vector reserve no-op still executes growth-path register saves.**
  The retained scalar4096 reserve-noop cell overlaps C++ but is separated
  slower than Rust in both cohorts of one launch. Reached WF and C++ paths
  eagerly save 64 bytes; Rust saves registers only after selecting growth.
  The source already returns early when capacity suffices. Investigate general
  fast-path frame placement, using the exact image and per-peer ranges in the
  [matched Vector API results](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#matched-edit-apis-inline-owner-zero-extents-and-local-swap-remove).
  Reopen with native evidence that removes no-op stack traffic without adding
  growth-path calls, copies or spills, then measure both widths and preserve
  reserve growth, arbitrary admitted capacities, allocation failure and owner
  cleanup checks. Instruction counts do not assign the observed timing cost;
  overlap alone establishes neither an unavoidable floor nor qualification.

- **Current Slots bulk shifts lack a same-layout paired selection.**
  The earlier header-first bulk-shift trial failed its no-regression criterion,
  while the inline-owner compiler currently emits a contiguous Slots memmove.
  The retained per-API peer panel observes that implementation, not an A/B
  comparison against its logical-index walk. The representation change reopens
  the question without attributing a gain or resolving the earlier scalar
  reuse loss. Before claiming a shift speedup, compare the current compiler
  against a walk-only variant with identical owner layout, source, peers and
  harness; retain small scalar reuse and wide owning-element controls, zero
  extents and wrapped Ring behavior. Record the criterion before measuring and
  reopen on any repeatable loss. The [earlier failed trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#slots-final-code-and-paired-timing-regression-prevents-selection)
  and [current API panel](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#matched-edit-apis-inline-owner-zero-extents-and-local-swap-remove)
  remain separate evidence.

- **Vector wide insertion still materializes records across bulk shifts.**
  The reached native wide insertion constructs a 256-byte offered record
  before `memmove` and spills 240 bytes across it; the Rust adapter constructs
  the same fields afterward. Full insertion also resizes then shifts, whereas
  C++ can copy prefix and suffix directly into their final positions. These
  are distinct costs: instruction counts alone do not attribute their timing.
  Reopen after the matched per-API measurements in the
  [Vector results](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md)
  with an ordinary-source witness separating pure value construction from
  effectful construction, and compare optimized IR plus reached native code.
  A lowering change must preserve evaluation, failure and ownership order;
  a fused growth/insert interface needs its own grounds. Swap-remove now avoids
  writing the removed owner into the retired slot, but reached wide code still
  materializes the last value into a local before an earlier-slot exchange;
  compare that remaining transfer with the peer paths before selecting another
  transform. Validate both element widths, spare/full capacity, exact returned
  contents and owner cleanup. Construction/destruction still need independent
  timing rows, followed by a current whole-Vector performance qualification;
  successful API correctness runs do not establish those missing measurements.

- **Box/window representation costs remain unqualified.** Runtime Slots uses
  an inline length/capacity/payload owner with an element allocation for positive physical extent; runtime
  Array, Ring and Segments retain thin owners and header-first allocations.
  `grow` trials full positive-extent reallocation, retains a disjoint initialized-prefix copy for partial windows, and changes zero-extent metadata without allocating. The small-growth tradeoff remains open. Owner width, measure loads, allocation
  count, copying and linked layout remain distinct costs: direct measure reads
  widen transport and capture storage, and no representation is established as
  generally faster. Separate these costs in representative single-thread and
  parallel comparisons. The successful bounded capture repair above is
  evidence about the synthesized task ABI; it neither attributes the earlier
  `records` failure nor proves that any one general layout choice caused it.
  Keep the deferred general representation study separate, and close this item
  only when the relevant costs and chosen tradeoffs have discriminating evidence.

  The [inline runtime-Slots owner screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#inline-runtime-slots-owner-registered-descriptor-placement-discriminator)
  removes the descriptor-pointer load and heap descriptor while retaining the
  separate payload, full realloc and allocated empty placeholder. It qualifies
  only two of six matched growth-append cells and does not by itself justify
  representation selection.
  Source and post-lowering linked ownership checks pass; worker lifetimes and
  changed containing-layout ceilings remain open. The independent
  [allocation-free empty-payload screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#allocation-free-empty-payload-registered-independent-discriminator)
  uses a target-aligned static anchor: its capacity-zero cells lie below both
  peers, but only the same two of six matched growth cells pass. Native call
  placement also changes without an inline directive, so that unpaired screen
  does not isolate allocator-route timing or establish a gain against B.
  That screen passed empty/zero-stride and post-lowering linked transport
  checks before the current representation amendment; it does not qualify
  the current compiler. Reopen with a discriminating
  hypothesis for remaining positive-capacity append costs, including
  allocator/setup-state attribution before another layout change, and a
  complete representation/lifetime qualification. The
  [scalar-4096 native census](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#scalar-4096-census-outcome-equal-extents-and-movement-in-both-orders)
  finds equal usable extents and address changes in all 31 contexts per peer
  and order. It refutes differing size classes or movement counts in that
  census only. The [preparation-history discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#scalar-4096-history-outcome-attribution-remains-unresolved)
  does not reproduce the original disjoint gap; WF's ordinary and common-read
  ranges overlap in both cohorts. Timed-run frequencies and preparation/cache
  attribution remain open. No allocator cause is yet established; preserve
  these evidence limits. The [growth-body/chain exposure trials](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#growth-exposure-outcomes-dispatch-removed-append-remains-unqualified)
  move the opaque edge to `reserve` when only the primitive is exposed, then
  remove repeated full/partial dispatch when the chain is exposed. The latter
  adds 224 bytes of wide vector stack stores/reloads and expands that append
  frame from 32 to 288 bytes; only two of six matched cells pass. Complete
  append exposure removes those spills and internal growth calls, with
  48-byte frames, but again passes only two of six cells and increases emitted
  WF instruction bytes from 16,160 to 17,860. Allocation/movement attribution
  remains open; no new route or size threshold is selected. Reopen body
  exposure with a new discriminating cost hypothesis and an account of
  aggregate placement and duplication, preserving the native prerequisite
  and full append comparison.
  No general inlining policy or causal timing improvement follows from these
  unpaired trials.
  The subsequent [paired full-growth route comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#full-growth-route-comparison-registered-attribution-experiment)
  isolates a route tradeoff on the complete-append overlay: malloc/copy/free
  beats realloc for scalar capacities 16 and 256 in both adjacent pairs and
  cohorts, but loses at wide capacity 4096; the other matched cells remain
  unresolved. This measures the route including its extra calls and register
  saves, not allocator internals alone. A uniform replacement is unsuitable;
  no size threshold is selected. Reopen with an explanation of the remaining
  cells and a policy whose growth and spare-append costs are both qualified.

  The [Vector length-store diagnosis](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#length-store-dependence-read-only-llvm-diagnosis)
  finds conservative header/payload dependencies in optimized take loops,
  despite length already being held in SSA. The qualified physical-index fact
  is already emitted; repeating it after optimization does not remove those
  dependencies. Extra alias metadata is therefore unselected, not a missing
  correctness fix. Reopen with a different complete mapping or source shape
  that removes the actual repeated stores. Validate unchanged-source native
  work and full timings, nested windows whose inner headers are outer payload,
  whole-owner writes and zero-stride elements before adopting a mapping.
  Defer this separate optimizer investigation while the allocation and
  consumption discriminators establish their costs; do not infer its elapsed
  benefit from alias-analysis output alone.

- **Checking accepts a program whose build stops at target layout.**
  `whitefootc --check` stops before lowering, so a program whose concrete
  layout the selected target cannot represent, such as a fixed-capacity
  array larger than the target's address domain [STOR-6], passes checking
  and stops only when built. Until v0.87 the common case was an allocation
  count bound the target could not hold, which cost the Snowghost PNG
  decoder's writer a round; [OP-9] now makes such a size heap exhaustion at
  run time, and no writer has met a remaining case. [STOR-6] permits a check
  command to qualify the host target, since its failure is no source
  rejection [DIAG-1], but `driver::check` is defined as the source-verdict
  projection that stops before lowering, `--check-module` selects no entry
  whose materialization set could be qualified, and qualifying requires
  lowering, whose cost on a check is unmeasured. The options are qualifying
  the host in `--check` when an entry is selected or a separate
  target-check option; this is a compiler decision for the owner. Validate a
  chosen form with an entry that keeps a local `Array<u8, 9223372036854775808>`
  stopping at check time as a `TargetLayout` stop with no rule, and with the
  check time of the corpus programs before and after. Reopen when a writer
  meets a build-only target stop.

- **Union-laid-out enums: deferred refinements.**
  [compiler/payload-enum-layout](../design/compiler/payload-enum-layout.md)
  is implemented: enums with two or more payload variants whose product does
  not return in registers are unions of per-variant views and memory-only in
  the backend (`Component` 168 to 40 bytes, `IoError` 228 to 12, the I/O
  results 236--352 to 16--112; the
  [results](../research/investigations/enum-union-layout/DESIGN.md#implementation-results)).
  The investigation's timing criterion was met for the Slab and
  priority-queue comparisons; its I/O half was waived by the owner because
  the named I/O programs no longer compile. Deferred refinements, each to be
  measured on its own: a first-class
  word carrier so register-sized two-payload enums (at most 8 bytes saved in
  the maintained programs) could also shrink, reopened by a workload storing
  many of them; niche encoding, reopened with refined integer domains or a
  workload dominated by `Option<Box<T>>`; a narrower tag, reopened by a
  workload of enums whose views are less than 4-aligned; and an enum with one
  payload variant that holds a union enum (`ReadStop`, `Option<IoError>`)
  keeps the product form and is memory-only only because of that payload,
  which is correct but copies it by memmove where its other fields alone
  would be first-class, reopened if a measured path moves many of them.

- **Runtime-content swap exchanges only headers, losing the allocation extent.**
  [OP-11 and TYPE-9](../spec/kernel-spec.md) admit the implicit `swap` instance
  over two runtime `Slots` contents; no runtime-content local or move is needed.
  The following sequence in a pure entry is accepted by both `--check` and
  `--emit-llvm` with the [frozen integrated-main compiler](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-main-integration-identical-executable-inputs-no-retiming):

  ```wf
  let empty = box_slots_new::<u64>(capacity: 0_u64);
  let full = box_slots_new::<u64>(capacity: 1_u64);
  place_back(window: &full.inner, value: 7_u64);
  swap(first: &empty.inner, second: &full.inner);
  if empty.inner.len > 0_u64 {
    let observed = empty.inner[0_u64];
  }
  ```

  [Swap lowering](../compiler/src/lowering/builder/prelude.rs) emits two loads
  and two stores of `{ i64, i64, [0 x i64] }`, exchanging only the descriptor.
  Both Box pointers remain unchanged: the exchanged length permits an
  eight-byte read at offset 16 in the original 16-byte empty allocation.
  This invalid read was identified in emitted IR; no native execution of the
  zero-capacity witness occurred. This is a lowering correctness defect,
  separate from the whole-Box swap measure-fact gap below.

  Assess retaining the owner slot in inferred runtime-content references and
  resolving the backing on each use, so content swap can exchange owner
  pointers. This candidate must preserve earlier same-path aliases under
  REF-2, reference joins and captures, and every measure, index, transfer,
  growth, release and admitted call-ABI consumer; rewriting only a direct
  swap call is insufficient. Written `&Slots<u64>` user parameters remain
  outside TYPE-9 admission. A separate helper taking two
  `&Box<Array<Box<u64>>>` parameters, retaining an alias to the first `.inner`,
  swapping the contents and reading through that alias is also source-accepted
  by the same frozen compiler (`--check` exit 0), but `--emit-llvm` exits 1 with
  `Lowering: InvalidCheckedProgram` and produces no LLVM bytes. Its inert main
  does not construct or execute those owning Arrays. Repair and audit runtime
  Array content lowering separately; do not confuse its unsupported lowering
  with the Slots descriptor-only miscompilation. Require source-admission
  controls, unequal capacities,
  same-place swaps, live aliases, nested/linear ownership, zero-stride and
  aligned payloads, and capture/linked-ABI checks. Use a padded or checked
  allocator oracle before executing the cap0 witness. Repair lowering without
  narrowing accepted source or selecting shared empty backing. The branch
  now implements the owner-slot repair under the
  [pending representation amendment](../design/amendments/runtime-content-references.md).
  The maintained runtime-content tests pass ordinary and retained links in
  both lowering modes, with exact concurrent release ledgers and a real worker
  grant; the affected backend and reference filters also pass. Keep this item
  open only for the separate performance attribution and any zero-stride
  workload it may expose. Shared-empty optimization remains deferred until
  that measurement.

- **Classify Segments content exchange after the main integration.** This is
  an **untested source/IR hypothesis**, with no observed source verdict or
  native result. [TYPE-9 and PRE-1](../spec/kernel-spec.md) place `Segments<T>`
  only in a Box and declare it noncopy; OP-11 exchanges the complete values
  at its two admitted places and REF-2 governs earlier exact-content aliases.
  [IrAddressed::is_runtime_content](../compiler/src/ir.rs) currently includes
  runtime Array and window contents but omits Segments. The
  [shared swap body](../compiler/src/lowering/builder/prelude.rs) therefore
  appears to select owned header loads and stores for Segments, while
  [Segments readers](../compiler/src/backend/emitter/segments.rs) expect the
  captured backing address. Hypothesis: unequal segment counts and bounds
  would exchange only headers or stop during lowering rather than exchange
  the complete content. Impact, if admitted: a Segments content exchange
  would fail OP-11 or leave aliases observing the wrong allocation extent.
  The untested scratch draft `segments-swap-witness-draft.wf` is retained
  outside the repository in the PR 108 preservation bundle
  `/private/tmp/whitefoot-pr108-pre-main-4dwglu_x/`. It builds lengths `[1]`
  and `[2, 2]` with distinct 11/22 payloads, forms content aliases before
  exchange, and observes segment counts, total element counts and values.
  Reopen at the next clean production CLI verification after this main
  integration: establish its source verdict and inspect emitted IR before
  executing it with an allocation-bounded observer. If confirmed, assess
  extending the existing owner-slot reference path and every Segments
  measure/range/ABI consumer, retaining unequal-count, equal-place and live
  alias controls. No source-rule change or new mechanism is selected by
  this code-reading lead; it is recorded while the serial container
  measurement proceeds, and a confirmed correctness defect must be repaired.

- **Runtime Array copy capability ignores the element type.** The same frozen
  compiler accepts a direct `.inner` swap between two `box_array_filled::<u64>`
  owners, contrary to OWN-1 and OP-11. Its blanket noncopy `Buffer`
  classification also provides an accidental OWN-1 barrier to forbidden bare
  runtime-content bindings. The branch repair derives runtime Array copy
  capability from its element and checks TYPE-9 at the owned-value boundary
  independently. Close this routine checker defect after direct and
  copy-bound swaps reject, bare content values reject under TYPE-9, and an
  unconstrained generic swap instantiated with `u64` remains admitted under
  FN-2. The [runtime-content investigation](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#runtime-capacity-content-references-and-exchange)
  records why these source controls are separate from native exchange.

- **A local `slots_new::<T, N>()` clears all N slots when it is created.**
  Snowghost's `match_complex` (`renderer/css/selectors/match.wf`) creates
  `slots_new::<Frame, 64>()`, 12-byte frames, on every call, and the code
  compiled at 290b575b clears the whole window first: its
  `proto_style_seq` driver calls `memset` for 0x308 bytes, 64 frames and
  the length word, at the function's start. In a callgrind profile of one
  style computation on the ECMAScript specification page (Snowghost
  58fa8ee's `proto_layout_seq`, collection limited to `compute_styles`),
  106 million calls made that `memset` 21 percent of the instructions
  (Snowghost `research/investigations/concurrency/DESIGN.md`, "Style's
  work per element"); Snowghost's rule index (ec21b7c) has since cut the
  calls, so the share is smaller now and not measured. [WIN-1] leaves every
  slot past `len` holding nothing and [OP-13] starts a `slots_new` window
  empty, and no access reads past `len`, so the clearing is not observable.
  Change: create an inline `Slots` window without clearing the slots past
  its length, checking first that no drop, move or bounds path in the
  lowering reads them, and measure a program that creates many
  short-lived windows. Not checked on a later revision. Reopen with the
  next change to `Slots` lowering or when a profile shows the clearing
  again.

## Parallel lowering and runtime

- **Wide local owners expand waiting callers and native compilation.** The
  [wide HashMap ownership witness](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#wide-owner-waiting-frame-cost)
  emits a 4.26 MB waiting caller against a 64 KB sequential clone after each
  node gains 31 inline words. Local parallel native builds take about eleven
  seconds while sequential builds stay below two. The improved Linux CI
  diagnostic identifies Clang `-O2` compilation as the native-child timeout.
  Equivalent fixed-size literal initialization reduces the maintained transfer
  fixture's parallel module to 0.87 MB and local Clang compilation below one
  second; the original loop remains at `e39dbc277`. Preserve its complete word,
  identity, cleanup and lowering-mode observations. Reopen with that loop to
  reduce redundant waiting-frame/aggregate transfers or compare bounded ordinary
  helper lifetimes, without increasing the deadline or suppressing overlap
  permission. Validate exact outcomes and native build/run phases
  separately; a smaller source shape alone does not resolve the general cost.

- **Addressed call results can suppress proved overlap.** In
  `lowering/builder.rs::overlaps`, promoting a non-final call result to local
  storage would read it before its join, so that call ends the offered group.
  Direct field observations of a returned Slots owner expose this boundary;
  the worker-owner regression uses ordinary consuming helpers to exercise
  the currently supported capture and return path. Investigate delaying the
  placement until the join, preserving every original permission and read
  ordering. Reopen when a real parallel workload loses overlap this way;
  validate direct field reads, worker capture, forced sequential fallback
  and exactly-once owner cleanup before measuring any gain.

- **The concurrent map's writers wait a count of pauses, not a time.** A
  writer that finds its key locked waits 16 to 1,024 pauses
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`, `wait_for_cell`), about 0.2 to
  12 microseconds on the 4-CPU measuring host, where a pause took about
  12 ns; pause latency differs several times over between x86 cores, so
  the same counts wait longer elsewhere and the batching that won one-key
  `update` may cost latency instead. A keyed statement's patience, 2^16
  pauses before it holds the whole map, is a count of pauses too, 0.77 ms
  on that host. The change: bound the waits by elapsed time, read from the
  cycle counter, or let keyed statements park. Reopen when the 14900K
  measures one-key `update`, when waiting writers park, or when holds show
  in a workload's profile or tail latency.

- **A keyed statement on an absent key allocates a node it then frees.**
  `wf_cmap_lock_entry` (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`) claims a
  cell for an absent key, reusing the first removed cell its probe passed,
  and allocates the key's node so the block can write `Some`; a block that
  leaves the entry `None`, a `GET` that misses, frees the node again. Misses
  no longer grow the table or lengthen the next probe (one key missed in
  rounds of 400,000 answered `SPOP` at 159,680 to 177,699 a second), but each
  costs an allocation and a free from the user's free lists. The change:
  claim without a node and allocate it when the block first writes the slot,
  which needs the lowering to call the runtime there, or keep a freed node on
  the user for the next claim of the same size. Reopen when a profile of a
  miss-heavy workload shows the allocation.

- **A keyed statement that waits for its entry spins and does not park.**
  Its wait is bounded, since one out of patience holds the whole map
  ([bounded waits](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#bounded-waits)),
  but the driver it runs on spins instead of running its other contexts:
  firn spent 15.9 µs of server CPU per `LRANGE mylist 0 599` reply on two
  drivers against 8.6 µs on one, every statement on the one list holding
  its entry. The change: let a keyed statement that has not yet locked
  anything suspend like an object statement, with a mark for waiters (a bit
  of the hash or a word beside the cell, since the key word's second bit
  marks a pending claim) that the entry's unlock reads to wake it. Validate
  by the `LRANGE` reply's server CPU on two drivers against one. Reopen when
  a workload on one key is limited by the server's CPU rather than its
  client, or with shared reads of one entry (Q37).

- **`SharedMap<unit>` and maps of other payload-free values do not lower.**
  The unlock reads the entry's `Option` tag as an `i32`
  (`emit_shared_map_unlock` in `compiler/src/backend/emitter/shared.rs`) and
  refuses a tag-only enum, which `Option<unit>` may lower to, so a byte-keyed
  set fails with `InvalidIr` instead of compiling. The change: read the tag
  at the width the enum's layout gives. Reopen when a program needs a set of
  byte strings shared between contexts.

- **Entry nodes over 512 bytes come from the pool under its one lock.**
  `new_node` takes a large key's node from the context pool, whose free
  lists sit behind one spin lock (`wf_pool_take` in
  `compiler/src/backend/completion/bridge.c`), while smaller nodes come from
  per-user chunks. A workload of long keys from many drivers would contend
  on it. Reopen when a measured workload's keys exceed 512 bytes.

- **A keyed statement takes two dependent cache misses where firn's old
  keyspace took one.** `wf_cmap_lock_entry`
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map.c`) loads the probed cell's key word
  and then the node it points to, both missing the cache under the suite's
  100,000 keys: under `INCR` at depth 16 on one server CPU it took 28.1% of
  firn's samples, 43% of them on the cell's load and 41% on the node's,
  while the old keyspace's bucket held the key and a short value together
  (`hash_map_edit`, 19.0%). On one server CPU firn answered `SET`, `GET` and
  `INCR` 8 to 12% below firn at `e92a54ed7`; on two the map's parallelism
  outweighs the miss. The change: keep a short entry's key bytes and slot in
  the cell's cache line, or start the probes of a pipeline's later requests
  before running the first. Reopen when a single-driver workload matters or
  the many-core run shows the misses limiting it
  (`research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md`, the suite).

- **Drivers park more often per request than Dragonfly's threads without
  pipelining.** At depth 1 on two server CPUs `redis-benchmark` is the limit
  (1.91 of its two CPUs, firn at 1.57 of its two); firn's threads slept 0.077
  times per `GET` against Dragonfly's 0.031, and the client spent 12.1% of
  its time waking the server in its send path against 7.1%, so the same
  client reached 2 to 7% fewer requests a second than against Dragonfly on
  11 of the suite's 19 tests, firn before the shared map alike. The change:
  let a driver spin for a bounded time before it parks in its completion
  wait, and measure what the spin costs an idle server. Reopen when depth-1
  rates on few cores become a goal, or with the next change to the
  completion wait.

- **Readers of one key take its entry one at a time.** Every keyed
  statement holds its entry exclusively, so the `LRANGE` tests, which all
  read one list, write their replies one at a time: on the 14900K firn
  answered `LRANGE_100` at 0.58, 0.61 and 0.44 of Garnet with 4, 8 and 16
  server CPUs, flat between 1.24 and 1.55 million a second
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)).
  The change: let a keyed statement whose block writes nothing through its
  binding read its entry beside other such statements, counting its readers
  in the entry's cell, which the shared-maps decision deferred to this
  workload (Q37); firn's `LRANGE` also removes an expired list in the same
  statement and would do that in a second one. Validate by `LRANGE_100`
  against Garnet at 4 server CPUs with no other test slower. Reopen as the
  next work after PR #202.

- **`ZADD` is held near a million a second by one key's critical section.**
  firn answered 907,000 to 1,127,000 a second at every server CPU count on
  the 14900K, 0.88 of Dragonfly at 2 and 0.95 at 16
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)).
  For a member already held, `add_ranked` (`apps/firn/commands/sorted.wf`)
  copies the member twice, descends the order twice to remove and put it,
  and hashes it again to store the score, inside the one key's statement.
  The change: reuse the removed rank's member, store the score through the
  first lookup, and profile what remains. Validate by `ZADD` at depth 16
  against Dragonfly at 2 and 16 server CPUs. Reopen with firn's next
  performance work.

- **A whole-map statement costs more as drivers are added.** firn's `MSET`
  fell from 1,243,000 a second at 4 server CPUs to 1,103,000 at 8 and
  802,000 at 16, 0.76 of Garnet there
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)):
  each whole-map statement waits for a keyed statement of every other
  driver. Whether the client also limits it at 16 was not measured. The
  change: first measure `MSET` at 16 with two client processes; if the
  server limits it, a statement over a list of keys taken in an order the
  runtime fixes (Q35, deferred by the shared-maps decision) holds only its
  keys. Reopen with firn's next performance work.

- **firn spends more CPU per `SADD` and `HSET` than before the shared map
  on four drivers.** On the 14900K with 4 server CPUs both firn and firn at
  `e92a54ed7` kept every CPU busy, and firn answered 0.96 and 0.94 of the
  earlier firn, 6% more CPU per request, while it answered more of `LPUSH`
  and `RPOP` on the same single keys
  ([many cores](../research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md#many-cores)).
  The cause is unattributed: the host had no `perf`. Validate by a profile
  of both on four drivers. Reopen with firn's next performance work.

- **Validate reuse of selected-target element layouts during emission.**
  [Zero-stride addressing](../compiler/src/target.rs) currently queries
  the ordinary layout calculator afresh for each element-address step. Repeated
  accesses to a deeply nested nominal element may recompute the same layout.
  Compare checking/emission cost on repeated nested-element accesses before
  introducing shared layout storage; require identical qualification and emitted
  addresses. The benefit and material cost are unmeasured, so keep the simple
  query for now and reopen when measuring target-emission cost or extending its
  layout consumers.

- **Parallel footprints omit ordinary result-list bindings.** The
  [sparse-routing trial](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#sparse-destination-routing-trial-2026-09-21)
  exposes a receiver map denied solely because one statement binds two local
  results. PAR-2 allows iteration-owned writes, but the current PAR-1/PAR-2
  walkers model one result definition per statement and refuse this form.
  A two-field record admits the same receiver map without added allocation or
  traversal; the retained form now qualifies useful helper discovery.
  Defer a general multi-definition footprint implementation; reopen when that
  workaround materially complicates a real consumer. Validate complete effects,
  consumption, exits and lowering for all result ordinals rather than granting
  a tuple-specific exception.

- **Initialized allocation can impose serial span on parallel work.** The
  [private-outbox representation](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#private-outboxes-without-frontier-compaction)
  requires a fresh C-by-D head matrix each level; its element fill is a
  sequential emitted loop before otherwise independent routing. Initialization
  remains linear work but can dominate the full critical path. The sparse
  oracle and useful helper work are now qualified, but the
  [FIFO comparison](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-phase-qualification-and-prospective-fifo-comparison-2026-09-22)
  stopped at its identical-image control. The end-to-end cost is not attributed.
  Measure fill/allocation separately from useful routing before choosing a
  general lowering change; preserve initial values,
  cleanup and the unchanged sequential image in any later experiment. Defer
  repair until a qualified cost comparison establishes materiality.

- **Loop capture selection remains conservative beyond forwarding.** The
  [needed-capture change](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#needed-loop-captures)
  retains every ordinary instruction and call argument. Removing an unused
  pure computation or an unused callee formal could shrink further frames,
  but needs independent effect and call-interface reasoning; no blocked
  consumer currently justifies that scope. Broader dead-computation or
  dead-formal analysis remains deferred: reopen
  when an otherwise useful map still exceeds the fixed frame bound, and
  validate smaller emitted frames on the same source without changing calls,
  cleanup or results before selecting that wider scope.

- **Pruning already-fitting loop frames needs a qualified benefit.** The
  [capture investigation](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#needed-loop-captures)
  now selects capture pruning only to rescue an originally oversized frame.
  Pruning fitting tasks changes transport and code placement without admitting
  a new loop, and records repeatedly reports an adverse W4 observation whose
  cause remains unresolved. Smaller frames could still help another consumer,
  but that benefit is unverified. Defer the broader optimization until a real
  fitting-frame consumer exposes a material transport cost; reopen with an
  unchanged-source comparison that retains native results, cleanup and a
  same-image null control, establishes its benefit and clears the protected
  records case before selecting the wider policy.

- **General DAG scheduling and competitiveness remain unqualified.** The
  [runtime-adjacency probe](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#runtime-adjacency-all-predecessor-probe)
  executes runtime-provided forward graphs with at most two predecessors and
  successors per vertex through ordinary WF source. Both owner mappings pass
  the original-edge oracle, including all such graphs through five vertices.
  Recursive owners overlap, but their joined rounds delay a ready task that
  the native readiness executor overlaps with another long task. The loop
  mapping retains zero split budget at the selected owner counts. Under
  topological numbering and contiguous ownership, rounds are bounded by C;
  routing adds O(C*C*R) work and two C*C head matrices. These results qualify
  the bounded expression, not arbitrary labeling/degree, general efficiency,
  elapsed competitiveness or physical peak workspace. Defer a general executor
  until a concrete consumer makes those remaining costs material. Reopen with
  its unchanged original graph, every result and exactly-once counts, charging
  sorting/remapping if needed, construction, initialization, routing, added
  precedences, wall/CPU and peak space against a useful native readiness
  executor. An owner-round limitation does not establish that every ordinary
  source formulation needs the same barrier.
  Separately, the bounded checked-call bridge recovered the selected A/D
  overlap while reducing observed C/D overlap across its fixed masks. The
  [amended identical-image control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#amended-cost-result-identical-image-control-failure)
  failed before any candidate comparison, so both the bridge and DONE-first
  runtime change are withdrawn for lack of cost qualification, not a measured
  implementation regression. Reopen only for a concrete call-group consumer
  and a bounded comparison with qualified measurement controls, unchanged
  results/edges and prospective wall/CPU protection for the other masks and W1.
  Recovered overlap alone selects neither implementation nor a broader executor.

- **Recursive frontier policy suppresses deep work on a spine with side leaves.**
  The [cutoff-attribution control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-qualification-and-cutoff-attribution)
  shows default W4 budget eight serializing task IDs 16 onward; the existing
  frontier-off mode restores deep overlap at lengths 16 and 32 on costly and
  last-heavy leaves. Preserving those offers may expose useful work, but its
  elapsed benefit, cheap/skew overhead and longer-spine space costs are unknown.
  Disabling the budget retains the runtime's 64 capture slots per lane, held
  until their enclosing joins. The stable-scatter result below also retains
  a 30–37 percent regression when that budget is disabled, so this observation
  does not select a global off policy. Defer policy changes until a concrete
  recursive consumer or a selected scheduling study makes the cutoff material.
  Reopen with unchanged task values, counts and edges; separate offered work
  from successful steals, account for live frames/slots, and qualify cheap,
  costly and skewed inputs across widths with prospective wall/CPU and W1
  criteria before adopting a replacement.

- **Parallel grain policy needs a dedicated study.** Captured extents are a
  provisional scheduling input, not an established broadly suitable policy.
  The [first same-source trial](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#runtime-extent-trial-result)
  improves prefix, histogram and stencil, but makes chain-pull 51 percent
  slower at two workers and incurs substantial CPU costs in some faster
  cases. Those measurements precede the continuation-accounting correction.
  The [frozen `6fdb6768` baseline](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#frozen-compute-baseline-2026-09-21)
  observes useful regular parallel work and substantial wide-stencil CPU cost;
  it does not isolate that correction's effect. Its scalar native controls do
  not establish optimized-native competitiveness. Study whether a robust common
  policy exists or workload, input shape, worker count and hardware require
  different choices, comparing wall time, CPU and scheduling/profile overhead.
  [Runtime profiles and PGO](ideas.md#parallel-grain-policies-and-runtime-profiles)
  are candidate inputs to that later study. The trial's failures remain
  evidence, not proof that no broadly useful strategy exists. Close this item
  when a policy meets explicit representative criteria or its accepted
  tradeoffs are recorded.
  The [first-index probe](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#native-expression-result)
  exposes a concrete input missing from current wave prices: data-dependent
  record lengths and early exit leave the same static estimate for one-byte
  and 65,536-byte records, and the small permitted waves receive no split
  budget. The [adjacent-helper result](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#adjacent-helper-pair-native-result)
  qualifies another source composition: the same two local-return blocks in
  ordinary calls execute nonempty absent/late-hit predicates on the caller
  and a helper, with observed overlapping lifetimes and preserved prefixes.
  The old counted form still has zero budget, and the cheap-first-hit case
  still pays for the other started block. A native two-block reference
  confirms the work contract, not pool competitiveness. At fixed offsets and
  descriptor lengths, payload-dependent early exit still changes actual work;
  bounds/read-only facts alone do not supply a representative price.
  Validate profitability on a representative costly search against a fair
  native reference, charging completed final-wave work, observer perturbation
  and scheduling/profile costs. The functional participation result selects
  no loaded-read, PGO or general grain policy.
  Defer further search pricing work until a concrete consumer requires it;
  reopen with that workload and a criterion that distinguishes useful overlap
  from merely higher worker participation. No lower threshold or new
  cancellation mechanism is selected by the expression result.

- **Array-helper pricing beyond original read-only references remains conservative.**
  The accepted [typed Box-array extent extension](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#read-only-box-array-helper-work-pricing)
  keeps static estimates for local owners, write-capable formals and references
  changed away from the original formal. Some unchanged forwarded references
  also lose the exact capture identity and fall back. Retaining those runtime extents could
  expose useful work, but their measured workload impact is unknown and a
  captured owner may already be consumed. Reopen when an affected helper's
  static price demonstrably withholds useful splitting and an existing checked
  validity fact or captured scalar measure can authorize the observation at
  every split site, including zero-trip loops. Defer broader transport until
  that case supplies both the benefit and the availability evidence; pricing
  must not infer a separate source lifetime.

- **Per-task loaded costs remain unavailable to loop work pricing.** The
  [phased spine](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#phased-spine-permission-and-work-price)
  has PAR-2 permission but emits the same static price 199 for cheap and costly
  leaves. At the current work unit, 754 iterations afford one chunk and 1,508
  first afford a positive split budget; all selected lengths through 32 remain
  unsplit, matching zero observed W4 overlap. Useful independent work may be
  withheld because a recurrence bound loaded inside a chunk is unavailable
  at its split site, even when the source input is read-only. Extent transport
  alone does not provide a representative task price for mixed loads. The
  [captured-scalar control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#captured-scalar-availability-control)
  transports the actual uniform leaf bound through the same helper chain:
  prices 48 and 655,398 retain sequential cheap/boundary controls and expose
  costly length-32 overlap on four W4 threads. All six cases pass at W1/W4
  in ordinary/traced images. This establishes scalar availability at the
  existing summary depth, but changes the input representation and derives no
  price for heterogeneous loads. Defer a general pricing change until a
  concrete variable-cost consumer supplies representative benefit criteria.
  Reopen with its unchanged IDs, values, exactly-once counts and original
  edges, preserving cheap/zero-trip controls and qualifying wall/CPU and W1
  overhead prospectively. Charge any added observation or aggregation reads,
  work and storage and establish validity at every split site; do not bypass
  the missing input with padding or manual grain. This is separate from
  read-only header extent transport and selects no pricing policy.

- **Zero-budget dispatch needs caller and placement attribution before adoption.** The
  [query-retained one-site control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#query-retained-control-result)
  meets its W4 criterion, but grows module text by 2,400 bytes and measures a
  2.97 percent W1 paired-median regression despite identical normalized W1
  instructions. It couples dispatch, pixel inlining and alias-check motion;
  it establishes neither standalone entry cost nor the benefit of applying
  the branch at every site. The general cdac candidate grows text by 3,920
  bytes (44.50 percent), including additional top-level inlining, with no new
  local timing. The subsequent
  [null-qualified Intel comparison](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#general-dispatch-reassessment)
  regresses records by 30.72 percent at W1 and 4.01 percent at W2. W1 never
  executes the added dispatch: its unchanged sequential chunk has different
  placement and a differently optimized caller. Neither cause is isolated.
  Withdraw the all-site optimization while retaining the existing query and
  splitter entry; a wrapper, noinline boundary or alignment policy needs its
  own grounds. Defer that broader optimizer/layout investigation behind the
  remaining compute-expression questions. Reopen with a comparable Intel host
  and a bounded control separating caller/stack changes from placement, with
  an identical-image control and full outputs, before selecting a general
  replacement. Require a demonstrated candidate benefit and qualification of
  the affected W1/parallel paths; a passing ARM or different-host run alone
  cannot clear the retained counterexample.

- **Stable scatter retains construction and packing costs.** The dated merged-model
  [joined-phase result](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#joined-phase-result-2026-09-21)
  identifies about 0.596 ms of chunk initialization and 0.569 ms of packing at
  W8, against a 1.930 ms ordinary mixed-input call. That image clears
  and copies a full inactive chunk payload per appended `None`, and expands
  aggregate transfers during input partitioning; borrowed tally/packing reads
  no longer retain that full-copy cost. These observations do not measure
  current main. A separate, unverified opportunity is to construct a single-use
  aggregate directly in its fresh placement destination, independently of
  whether inactive payload bytes are cleared. Feasibility across ordinary call
  boundaries and loop re-entry, and the whole-call benefit, remain unestablished.
  Defer this behind the current pricing, sparse-discovery and baseline work.
  Reopen when current optimized code reproduces material staging traffic;
  compare unchanged source, require that transfer to disappear, qualify whole-call
  wall/CPU results, and preserve enum/affine snapshots, alias behavior, window
  length updates and exact-once cleanup. The shared destination-initialization
  trial above was rejected; its initialized-value argument and measured
  tradeoffs do not establish which scatter paths benefit or their
  whole-call cost. Those source-specific observations remain unmeasured.
  A direct `Array` replacement is not admitted: `Chunk` contains `nocopy`
  slots and the fill constructor requires a copy element. Any alternative
  affine construction interface needs its own language/library grounds.
  Expanding the existing recursion frontier supplies no qualified win at 32;
  disabling it makes mixed input 30–37 percent slower at W2/W4/W8 despite more
  successful steals. Investigate packing span/batching or a balanced output
  representation while preserving stable order and machine-checked bounds.
  Short-phase CPU counter deltas and several small/skew controls remain
  unqualified, so they do not diagnose worker idleness. No general grain policy
  follows. Close this item only after the remaining construction and packing
  costs meet explicit work, space and performance criteria, or their tradeoffs
  are accepted.

- **The formal compute comparison has unresolved attribution and measurement costs.**
  The separate [amended DAG cost control](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#amended-cost-result-identical-image-control-failure)
  completed all forty identical-image cells with correct results and adequate
  interval resolution, but two cells exceeded their fixed symmetric wall/CPU
  criteria. No candidate comparison ran. The variation is unattributed and
  supplies neither a compiler-regression verdict nor evidence of host noise;
  any later attribution needs its own bounded discriminator, not a favorable
  rerun or relaxed threshold. The
  [retained-data diagnosis](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#follow-up-diagnosis-of-retained-identical-image-variation)
  reproduces all reductions but finds a CPU delta exceeding the eight-CPU
  wall-interval capacity, substantial within-process CPU variation, and fixed
  per-family label order in the earlier BFS control. Establish short-interval
  CPU accounting separately from cumulative process totals before using those
  deltas to diagnose worker idleness. Per-thread activity, placement and
  competing-load observations are absent, so neither runtime work nor the
  wall-time variation is attributed. Preserve both stopped controls and defer
  scheduling or threshold changes. The completed
  [two-process baseline diagnostic](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#baseline-cpu-accounting-result-short-interval-attribution-failure)
  found no work-batch violation, but 25 of 65 W4 gap counter deltas exceeded
  physical capacity despite compatible enclosing and terminal CPU totals.
  Short-boundary attribution is therefore contradicted; it is no longer an
  unanswered validity question. The remaining measurement work is to establish
  accuracy at useful longer intervals and the selected comparison scale with
  independent accounting evidence before interpreting CPU cost. A compatible
  lifetime total does not supply that accuracy. No replacement clock is
  selected, no outcome clears the old null, and the separate wall-time
  variation remains unattributed. Reopen on a bounded discriminator for those
  remaining questions, preserving this result if it is uninformative.
  [Hosted observations](../research/investigations/test-economy/redesign.md#identical-image-host-control-failure)
  include an identical-image stencil control failing the unchanged three-percent
  band, and a separate actual records comparison failing at two widths while
  later runs retain a one-width suspect. A null failure supplies no compiler
  regression verdict, and a later pass does not explain an earlier failure.
  Attribute host/sample variability separately from emitted code, linked layout
  and runtime changes before changing a policy or declaring the suspect noise.
  The [PR 70 comparison at `7044db24`](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/35539977014)
  still fails for `records`: baseline/candidate wall-time ratios are 0.938915
  at two workers and 0.882544 at four, adverse in all five pairs at both
  widths; the other four kernels pass. Identical-image and intentional-slowdown
  qualification steps pass. The subsequent
  [bounded capture repair](../research/investigations/access-effects/parallel-array-captures.md)
  passed the unchanged formal comparison at every width: `records` ratios were
  1.087361, 1.004834 and 1.060012 at W1, W2 and W4, and all five kernels passed.
  Its identical-image control nevertheless retained a `records` W4 suspect at
  0.962815708 with four adverse pairs. The concrete PR 70 regression is repaired,
  while its cause and the earlier and remaining control variation are not
  attributed. The
  [result-register placement controls](../research/investigations/result-registers/DESIGN.md#hosted-compute-regression)
  show on a local Intel host that shifting records' two loop copies by 16 to
  48 bytes, with no executed instruction changed, moves main or that
  investigation's rejected merged-returns lowering by up to 18% and reverses
  their order at W2 and W4, while moving only the runtime does not. Its
  selected lowering's byte-identical records images read 1.073 at W1 on an
  EPYC 7763 and 0.855, a single-width suspect, on an EPYC 9V74. The
  [PR 78 hosted records inspection](../research/investigations/compute-model/DESIGN.md#records-w4-hosted-comparison-remains-unresolved)
  retains repeated W4 suspects at `30198a19` and `53c68c29`: the latter has
  wall/CPU ratios 0.898002/0.908317 with four adverse pairs, while its records
  null is not suspect. Exact x86 objects show unchanged hot work and runtime
  objects alongside reduced capture transport and changed linked placement;
  they establish no cause or fix. Existing raw data lacks scheduling counters,
  and ARM or emulated results cannot clear this Linux signal. A retained-image
  W4 paired/null counter check is a possible discriminator, not selected or
  run. Defer mechanism changes until evidence distinguishes the possible causes;
  reopen on selection of a bounded Linux attribution experiment and preserve
  the suspect if that experiment is uninformative. Keep this item
  until the observations and measurement/detection tradeoff are explained by
  discriminating evidence, rather than a later pass or changed threshold.

- **A `propagate` statement cannot be a [PAR-1] window member.** The rule
  admits only `let`-bound and scrutinee calls, so `let a = f(); let b =
  propagate g();` never overlaps. Allowing a `propagate` second member would
  need the lowering to join the hand-out before the `Err` return; a future
  investigation, taken up when a real program shows the gap.

- **Alias facts for worker-run loop chunks.** A synthesized loop-split chunk
  or splitter has no source signature, so its range and reference captures
  carry no `noalias`. The sequential world inlines the chunk into its source
  function, which has the facts; a chunk run as a worker lane does not, so a
  vectorizable chunk loop may keep a runtime overlap check. The facts would
  need their own derivation from PAR-2 independence and the enclosing call's
  EFF-5 result, since sibling chunks write other parts of the same captured
  range concurrently. Impact and whether any current kernel pays such a check
  are unmeasured. Validate by inspecting the optimized worker chunks of the
  formal compute kernels for `vector.memcheck` and, where one appears,
  comparing chunk time with and without a hand-added fact. Deferred because
  the range-reference change covers source signatures only; reopen when a
  measured parallel kernel shows the check.

- **Compute-bench private adapters still pass aggregate ranges.**
  `research/experiments/compute-bench/array_reference_host.ll`,
  `first_index_host.ll`, `dag_fanin_host.ll` and the first-index observation
  rewrite in that Makefile spell a range argument as one `{ ptr, i64 }`
  aggregate. The compiler now passes it as pointer and count; the machine code
  is identical on the admitted targets, but LLVM text bound into a WF module
  must use the split form, and the first-index rewrite no longer matches the
  emitted head and refuses. These dated research inputs were left unchanged;
  update them before running those experiments with a compiler that includes
  the split, keeping an older baseline arm on its own adapter.

- **A discarded affine result's call never joins a hand-out group.** Its
  expression statement runs the result's release immediately after the call,
  reading the value between a hand-out and its join, so
  `compiler/src/lowering/builder.rs` leaves that call unrecorded and it ends
  any overlap group through it, although PAR-1 permits it exactly as the
  let-bound call. It could instead be a group's last member, as an addressed
  binding already may. No measured
  program discards an affine result beside an independent call, so the
  benefit is unverified. Reopen when such a program appears; validate by
  emitting the call as the join site with its release after the join and
  comparing published bytes at several worker counts with the sequential
  lowering.

- **A rebound reference parameter's holder read overlaps every access
  through it.** PAR-1 reads a reference variable's own binding at each use,
  which the `let` that forms it or a `set` that rebinds it writes. A
  reference parameter's binding also stands for the place it names, so once
  a body rebinds the parameter (`set values = &values^[0_u64..8_u64];`),
  that holder read overlaps every write through `values` and denies pairs
  PAR-1 permits, such as a call writing one range of `values` beside a `let`
  that forms another. Giving the holder a place root of its own, which
  overlaps only itself, would separate the two. Validate with that pair
  permitted again and the rebinding still ordered against the uses after it.
  Found in the review of the holder-read fix; reopen when a program rebinds a
  reference parameter on a parallel path.

- **PAR-1 reads nothing for a range formed through a Box.** A `let` whose
  initializer forms a reference records no read of the place the reference
  starts from, so PAR-1 permits
  `let data = box_array_filled::<u64>(count: 2000000_u64, value: 0_u64);`
  beside `let all = &data.inner[0_u64..2000000_u64];`
  (`research/experiments/par-quicksort/quicksort.wf:73`) although forming the
  range loads the Box's pointer, which the first statement writes. No
  program observes it: the lowering hands out only calls, and a member that
  is not a call ends every overlap group (`overlaps` in
  `compiler/src/lowering/builder.rs`). Forming a reference to storage held
  in place needs only its address, so only a path through a Box's `inner`
  reads its owner. Record a read of the owner above each `inner` step a
  formed path passes; validate with that pair denied, the rest of the
  quicksort ledger unchanged, and `let larger = &v^[after..n];` still
  permitted beside `quicksort(v: smaller);`. Found while checking the
  parallelism article's ledger; reopen before the lowering admits a member
  that is not a call.

- **Parallel actualization is decided during translation.** A counted-loop
  split is chosen while its body is being lowered
  (`compiler/src/lowering/builder/split.rs`). The rescue mechanisms follow
  from that order: an oversized candidate's finished graph is transferred into
  its parent with every `IrFunction` field remapped by hand, ordinals are
  reserved late and the ledger rotates. Offer policy is spread over lowering,
  a call-grain post-pass, the emitter's lane-fit filter and the launcher, and
  the clone set is computed three times. Lowering the ordinary graph first and
  actualizing in one IR-to-IR pass whose plan the emitter only renders (the
  [architecture investigation](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p4-lowering-and-backend)'s P4.1) removes
  the transfer and lowering's use of the target layout. It replaces the
  graph-transfer decisions in
  `design/compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds.md`, so it needs a ruling.
  Validate with byte-identical LLVM for `tests/programs` and the `--par` test
  sources. Reopen when the next parallel-lowering experiment has to change the
  split.

- **A short context costs about 1.5 microseconds on several drivers.** With
  four drivers, a thousand batches of a thousand contexts that return at once
  took 1.47 seconds against 0.15 on one driver, and 0.92 and 1.35 at two
  and four drivers in Experiment 6
  (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, Experiments 5 and 6): idle drivers
  take half of the starter's queue, and the contexts, their arenas and the
  group count then move between cores for work of about 100 nanoseconds.
  A start joined by the next statement stays on one driver and costs what it
  does on one. A context that waits for the host amortizes this; one that
  computes briefly does not. Keeping a context on the starter's driver until
  it has run for a while, or stealing only from a queue longer than a
  threshold, would bound it. Reopen when a program starts many contexts that
  do little before they finish.

- **Only Linux with a ring runs several drivers.** With no kernel ring (the
  readiness route) and on Windows, every context still runs on the entry's
  thread: the readiness route's poll list and the completion port's wait are
  a single driver's. A second driver there needs a readiness registration per
  driver (`epoll` or `kqueue`) and, on Windows, a completion port per driver
  or one shared port whose completions carry their driver. Reopen when a
  server on either route needs more than one core.

- **A readiness wait and a helper's completion are found by scanning.** A
  record published on the thread that runs the contexts wakes its context by
  address, but one a helper thread publishes is found by a pass over every
  parked context, and with no ring every readiness wait is one `poll` over
  every waiting descriptor. Both are linear in the waiting contexts per wake.
  An `epoll` or `kqueue` registration, and a helper publication that queues
  its waiter, would make them proportional to the completions. Reopen when a
  many-context measurement on the helper or no-ring route attributes time to
  either pass.

- **Windows contexts run only on the completion port's route under test.**
  The Windows host job (`io-hosts.yml`) runs the two context cases of
  `compiler/tests/programs/network.rs`: twelve reverse-order peers each
  served in its own context with the completion port required, and two bound
  fetches on both routes. Without the port a Windows context's socket wait
  is a blocking helper wait, because that host has no readiness wait, so a
  server there holds a helper thread per silent peer, up to the adapter's 256
  helper records, past which it stops with a report. A `WSAPoll` readiness
  wait would give it the Linux readiness route's behavior. Reopen when a
  Windows server has to run without the port.

- **A wait on another context on a helper costs a thread.** Once contexts
  run, a stream write on every host, a stream read on every host but Linux
  with its ring, a connect on a host with no ring, and an accept on Windows
  run on helper threads, and the pool grows past its eight
  helpers while every helper is inside such a wait
  (`completion/file_adapter.c`, `wf_file_grow_for_peers_locked`). Each such
  wait in flight holds a thread, and a program with more than 256 at once
  stops with a report (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`,
  section 10.6). A readiness-driven adapter, one `poll`, `kqueue` or
  `WSAPoll` over every queued descriptor made where an idle thread already
  parks, would hold none for sockets; a standard stream shared with other
  processes would stay on helpers, since making it nonblocking would change it
  under them. Validate by a harness case of 257 socket waits running to
  completion on one thread and by the context echo server's rate on the
  no-ring route. Reopen when a program needs more than a few hundred such
  waits at once or a profile shows their threads.

- **The context echo server's rate at 1024 connections and with 64 KiB
  messages moved between sessions.** With R1 to R4 as committed,
  `tcp_contexts.wf` ran at 0.968 of the runtime before them at 1024
  connections (0.966 and 0.964 in two runs of 15 interleaved passes) and at
  1.047 with 64 KiB messages; with the stop check fixed, in a later session,
  it ran at 1.004 at 1024 connections (1.044 and 0.993) and at 0.971 with
  64 KiB messages, while 64 connections stayed within 1% in both sessions
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 10.5).
  Whether the progress changes cost anything at those workloads is open: the
  later session's two runs at 1024 connections differ by 5.1 points, more
  than the 3.6 points between the sessions, and the 64 KiB figure moved 7.6
  points the other way. Settle it by running the same two builds interleaved
  in three or more sessions; if a loss persists, attribute it with one build
  per change reverted, the candidates being the `wf__context_pass` call after
  every host operation its start answered, the reap after every 64
  resumptions, the per-driver count of host waits and the stop check's change
  counters. Reopen when a server with more than a few hundred connections or
  with messages of tens of KiB is measured, or before the next change to the
  driver loop.

- **The compiled context server trails the hand-written shape at 64
  connections.** At one driver thread each, `tcp_contexts.wf` held 0.88 of
  `waiting_echo --threads 1` in Experiment 2, 0.84 and 0.93 in Experiment 3
  and a median 0.81 in Experiment 4, whose server CPU per round trip was
  9.80 against 7.93 microseconds with the same system calls
  (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, Experiment 4). About 0.55
  microseconds is the ring's task-run mode: the reference built with the
  runtime's `COOP_TASKRUN` instead of `SINGLE_ISSUER | DEFER_TASKRUN` loses
  0.55. About 0.4 is the general completion engine's user-space work (about
  650 instructions per round trip against the reference's 195). About 0.9
  microseconds of kernel time is unattributed. A ring the driver owns and
  waits on directly, as the reference's, removes the first and most of the
  second. Since Experiment 5 every driver but the entry's has a ring only its
  own thread submits to and reaps, which is the single-issuer condition; the
  entry's ring is also the process's, which threads that are not drivers
  submit to, so it would need a ring of its own first. Reopen with that
  ring, and measure the unattributed kernel time against a smaller working
  set.

- **Frame memory for a context with small state is unmeasured.** Experiment 3
  measured idle connections of `tcp_contexts.wf`, whose 64 KiB echo window
  lives in `serve`'s frame, so frames and stacks both touched about 17 pages
  per connection (70.0 and 68.0 KiB) and the comparison showed only the page
  rounding around the window (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`,
  Experiment 3). Where a stack still touches at least one page per context, a
  frame should touch only its own bytes plus a 1 KiB context record and a
  1 KiB first chunk, which the runtime could allocate as one block. Measure a
  server whose per-connection state is a few hundred bytes, frames against
  the stackful build, before claiming a memory advantage; reopen when a
  program with small per-connection state, such as a proxy that shares its
  buffers, is written.

- **A 16-byte shift of a kernel's code changes its measured speed by 40
  percent.** The `records` compute kernel's hot function,
  `wf__par_seq_summarize_records`, runs about 21 ms at one worker when it
  starts at image offset 0x3200 and about 29 ms at 0x3210, with identical
  instructions: cachegrind counts 2,512,523,716 and 2,512,524,120. One more
  imported libc function adds a PLT entry before `.text`, which is enough to
  move it. The stackful waiting-context floor's `mprotect`, since removed,
  did that, and so did an unrelated `getpagesize` import linked beside the
  base runtime. The measured
  times were 20.7 ms for the base, 29.5 ms for the base with the extra import
  and 28.5 ms for the candidate floor: medians of eleven runs on a 2.1 GHz
  Xeon. `compute-regression` then reports `records` as adverse at two widths
  for a change that leaves the kernel's generated code identical. Every later
  runtime import will do the same. Align emitted functions and loop headers
  (for example 64-byte function alignment, or building kernel objects with
  `-mbranches-within-32B-boundaries`), measure the kernels under both
  placements, and adopt whichever makes their time independent of the
  offset. Reopen when the next compute-regression verdict names a kernel
  whose generated code did not change.

- **Every atomic statement holds its object alone.** Statements whose
  blocks only read could share the object, but lowering always acquires for
  writing
  (`design/language/waiting/shared-objects.md`, the provisional exclusive
  acquisition decision). Readers that contend then wait for one another.
  The runtime's entries take a read request, but lowering makes none, so
  that path runs in no program; deciding it needs a measured workload where
  readers contend, compared with
  a lowering that acquires for reading when the block writes no path rooted
  at the binding. Reopen when a program's atomic statements that only read
  are seen to queue.

- **An atomic statement counts its own handle.** Each statement adds one to
  the object's handle count before it acquires and releases it after it
  unlocks, two atomic read-modify-writes on a shared cache line that keep the
  object live whatever the block does with the target place [SHARE-2]. A
  block that neither moves nor writes the target's root, which is the common
  case and a fact the checker has, needs neither. Measure the uncontended
  statement with and without them; reopen when atomic statements show in a
  profile, as they may in the Redis subset.

- **A shared object takes at least one 512-byte pool block.** The bridge's
  pool serves blocks from 512 bytes up, so a `Shared<u64>` occupies 512
  bytes. A program with one keyspace object does not notice; one with an
  object per client or per key would. A smaller class for objects, or the
  ordinary allocator, would fix it. Reopen when a program creates many small
  objects.

- **No test watches for a write a borrower gives back.** A statement in a
  map's block that borrows a hold handed to a parked context and writes the
  object wakes the contexts watching for a write when it gives the hold back
  (`completion/bridge.c`, `wf_shared_give_back_locked`).
  `completion/shared_object_test.c` steps contexts with hand-written frames
  through every hand-off and borrow, but none of its contexts waits on a
  false guard, so a give-back that left the watchers asleep would pass. The
  change: a context whose guard reads a value only a borrower writes, which
  the test checks wakes after the borrower's give-back. Reopen when the
  lock changes again or a lost watcher wake is suspected.

- **A bound spawn is joined before the whole statement that uses it.**
  [WAIT-3] joins a bound spawn at the beginning of the first later statement
  of its block that names the binding or may leave the block, so in
  `let seen = spawn consume(…); if go { atomic … { … } return seen; }` the
  call is joined before the `if`, and the atomic statement that would make
  its guard true never runs. Joining on the path inside the statement instead
  was refused because later code would merge a joined and an unjoined path
  (`design/compiler/waiting-contexts`, the bound spawn's join). Reopen when a
  program needs the use and the enabling statement in one compound statement.

- **A split loop too small to split still costs its query at every call.**
  Snowghost's layout prototype runs `pkg::text::line_break`, whose
  `write_run_span` loop is a synthesized range split called once per run of
  a paragraph; its runtime work never reaches the work unit. Its layout
  mode that hands out nothing else (L1) is 5 to 24 percent slower at two
  and four workers than at one on every measured page. With that one loop
  made unsplittable in a local build, the flat page's L1 took 1.52 s at
  four workers against 1.57 s at one, where the committed build took 1.80
  s against 1.53 s
  ([Snowghost layout measurement](https://github.com/mbbill/Snowghost/blob/7f7542f/research/investigations/concurrency/DESIGN.md#layout-measurement)).
  The cost is the splitter's runtime query, paid per call when workers
  idle; the retained splitter entry of `compiler/parallel-lowering` was
  qualified on kernels whose splits are few and large. Change to evaluate:
  skip the query when the call's priced work is below the work unit, as the
  caller already knows the extents it prices. Validate with the flat page's
  L1 at one and four workers and the formal kernels' compute regression.
  Reopen with the next range-split or dispatch change.

- **Small allocations in a parallel loop slow down with more workers.** In
  the [scatter measurement](../research/investigations/segmented-storage/DESIGN.md#measurement-where-the-outputs-go)
  a loop allocating one small buffer per item (about 200,000 allocations
  per repetition) took 0.71 s sequentially and 1.15 s and 0.98 s at two
  and four workers. The heap is the platform `malloc` [STOR-8], shared by
  every worker. Change to evaluate: per-worker allocation caches in the
  runtime, or a bump region per split chunk for allocations that die with
  the loop. Validate with that measurement's A2 build at one, two and four
  workers. Reopen when a measured program's per-item allocations sit on a
  parallel loop's critical path.

- **An inline range argument does not carry its length into a
  postcondition.** `box_segments_filled`'s record ensures
  `result.inner.len == lengths^.len`. When the argument is a binding,
  `let run = &a.inner[0_u64..3_u64];`, the caller learns the segment count
  3; when the same range is formed at the argument,
  `lengths: &a.inner[0_u64..3_u64]`, `&segments.inner[2_u64]` stays
  unproved, so writers must bind the range first
  (`tests/conformance/cases/fn9-pos-segments-count-postcondition.wf` binds
  it).
  The formation's endpoint images are recorded under its capture, but the
  clause instantiation reads the argument's length only through a bound
  holder. Change: instantiate a range argument's `len` from the
  formation's captured length as a binding's is. Validate with the inline
  form of that case discharging the bound. Reopen with the next change to
  call-site clause instantiation.

- **An effect-row path through a segment is typed as the whole run.** The
  effect-row resolver (`container_element_type` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/types.rs`) has no `Segments` arm, so a row
  such as `writes(s.inner[k])` with a value parameter `k` selects the
  `Segments` type itself instead of a run of T. No program needs such a
  row yet: a helper takes the segment as its own `&[T]` parameter. Change:
  give a segment index step the range selection a range step has, and add a
  compiler test for a row naming one segment. Reopen when a writer needs a
  row that names one segment of a run it receives whole.

- **A fixed recursion budget cannot follow an unbalanced tree.** The budget
  of `compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds` is now spent only at calls in
  an actualized group, but its depth is still fixed per pool width (about
  eight levels at four workers). Snowghost's style shape B on apollo11 has
  its work under a few children of wide sibling runs, so the halvings above
  it spend the levels and the heavy subtree runs sequentially: a stage
  speedup of 1.14 at four workers, while whole runs with the budget off or
  pinned at 24 are about 3.7 to 3.8 times faster than at one worker
  ([recursion budget at splits](../research/investigations/call-offer-grain/DESIGN.md#the-recursion-budget-at-splits)).
  Candidate change: refresh the budget where offered work is taken by an
  idle worker, so depth follows demand rather than a static count; it
  revises that node and needs a measured comparison on the formal recursive
  kernels (quadrature, merge sort, quicksort) and shape B. Reopen with the
  next Snowghost style measurement or recursion-budget change.

- **The call-offer grain is provisional.** `--par` now offers a
  statement-group call only when its callee reaches a cyclic call component
  or its static work reaches the 150,000 work unit
  ([call-offer grain](../research/investigations/call-offer-grain/DESIGN.md#implementation-results),
  `design/compiler/parallel-lowering.md`). Two known limits no measured program exercises: a
  non-recursive helper whose work is large only through its runtime extents
  loses its offer, and a cheap call into a recursive component keeps one;
  and a callee that reaches recursion only by starting a waiting context is
  not seen as recursive, since neither this pass nor the recursion frontier
  follows a context start as a call edge. Validate any of them by a program whose four-worker time loses to its
  `--par-call-grain off` build; reopen when one appears.

- **Offers beneath a waiting recursion carry no recursion budget.** A
  cyclic component with a waiting member gets no budget-carrying family
  (compiler/parallel-lowering/two-worlds), because a waiting function is a
  resumable frame with no ordinary entry for a variant to stand behind.
  Every activation of such a recursion therefore reaches its offers
  unbudgeted, as a `--par-recursive-frontier off` build does. In
  `tests/programs/wfgrep.wf` the waiting `walk` and `search_root` recursions
  reached `name_before`'s byte-pair offers at every depth; the call grain now
  omits those offers (static work 4), so wfgrep, the one maintained program
  known to have such offers, no longer does, and whether one costs anything
  is unmeasured.
  Validate with a program whose waiting recursion reaches an offer the grain
  keeps, timed on a deep and on a wide input against a build that withholds
  the offer; if the unbudgeted offers cost measurable time, give waiting
  components a budget-carrying frame variant. Reopen when such a program
  appears.

- **The multi-result-list decision names a set target list the grammar
  lacks.** `design/language/surface-form/multi-result-list.md` says a result
  list is "bound only by a destructuring let or a set target list", but
  [GRAM-4]'s `set_stmt` is `"set" place "=" expr ";"` and the
  specification has no target list. A reader looking for that form finds
  none. Change: drop the set target list from the decision, or add the form
  if a program needs to assign a result list to existing places. Reopen
  with the next edit of that node.

- **A statement that binds an ordered result list never overlaps its
  siblings.** [PAR-1] lets two adjacent statements overlap when their paths
  are disjoint, but the pair judgment in
  `compiler/src/semantic/permission.rs` describes one definition per
  statement and refuses `let (a, b) = f(...);` [CALL-4] as a form, so two
  independent calls that return result lists never run as a pair. The
  counted-loop survey in `compiler/src/semantic/loop_permission.rs` gives
  such a statement its right-hand side's footprint and each binder the
  iteration's own binding; the pair judgment would give each binder its own
  definition path the same way. Validate with two adjacent binder-list
  calls on disjoint storage: permitted as a pair and splitting, with the
  sequential build's output. Reopen when a program's pair of such calls
  costs measurable time.

## Platforms and host interfaces

- **Upstream LLVM on Darwin does not yet support the selected stack-probe
  spelling.** The [Deque comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  records LLVM 22.1.8 rejecting native construction of the unchanged baseline
  with `Unsupported stack probing method`; the emitted
  `"probe-stack"="__chkstk_darwin"` remains present. Parsing and optimization
  succeed, and the native builder's Apple Clang path works, so this does not
  establish a failure of the new address fact. Before offering upstream LLVM
  as a native Darwin consumer, determine the supported probe form and link
  requirements and validate large-frame and recursive exhaustion through the
  existing floor tests. Disabling probes is not an acceptable workaround.
  Defer this separate toolchain extension while the current native path is
  supported; reopen when another native Darwin consumer is required.

- **There is no source-level foreign-function boundary.** C enters only as a
  trusted linked definition of an ordinary declaration [PRE-2, SCOPE-3], which
  the checker cannot inspect, and a C program cannot call Whitefoot code
  through a stated ABI. A real systems program needs both directions: calling
  an existing C library, and exporting a Whitefoot component, which the next
  entry covers. Import needs an explicit contract for ownership, layout,
  callbacks, foreign threads and failure, and a statement of what the
  compiler trusts; a checked wrapper and a source-level replacement are the
  alternatives to compare on one real dependency. This interacts with the
  module design for separate compilation. Close when a specified import
  boundary and its conformance cases land, or the owner records why a
  narrower boundary suffices.
- **Deliver a Whitefoot component as a safe C library.** The owner wants both
  delivery forms studied (2026-09-25): a C, C++ or Rust program should use a
  Whitefoot component the way programs use Wuffs's decoders, without taking
  on Whitefoot's lifetime and alias rules.
  (a) Emit C source for the component, as Wuffs does: portable to any C
  toolchain and reviewable, but the emitted C must never reach C's undefined
  behavior where Whitefoot's meaning is defined (signed overflow, strict
  aliasing, oversized shifts, uninitialized reads), may carry a proved fact
  only through a C construct with the same meaning (`restrict`, an assumption),
  and puts the C compiler in the trusted base in place of LLVM.
  (b) Emit an object or static library and a generated header through the
  existing LLVM backend, with a C-ABI export shim kept apart from the
  compiler's internal function ABI, which can change without notice.
  Either way the exported surface is where Whitefoot's guarantees meet an
  unchecked caller, so, as the
  [C ABI capsule idea](ideas.md#safe-c-abi-capsules) sketches, boundary code
  validates every argument before Whitefoot code receives it (requirements,
  lengths, overlapping buffers, handle generations, ownership transitions,
  the calling thread), and a violation returns an error value with no partial
  mutation; nothing a C caller passes is trusted. Validate one component, such
  as raw DEFLATE decoding or UTF-8 validation, through each route: the capsule
  misuse tests (stale handles, double drop, overlapping buffers, short
  outputs, allocation failure), a C test harness, a fuzzing run through the C
  API, and throughput against the Whitefoot-native build, recording what each
  boundary check costs. The exported interface builds on the module design.
  Take it up after the current correctness fixes land; close when one route
  ships with its boundary specified and tested, or the owner records why one
  route suffices.
- **The driver's clang lookup is a fixed path.** `clang_executable()` in
  `compiler/src/bin/whitefootc.rs` hard-codes `/usr/bin/clang` on Linux/macOS
  (`clang` on PATH on Windows), so a host whose clang lives only elsewhere — a versioned-only `clang-18`, a
  Nix profile, or Homebrew LLVM — cannot run the driver even with clang
  installed. Validate whether to accept an
  explicit override, for example an environment variable, without changing
  which clang CI uses. Close when the owner decides for or against the
  override and, if accepted, its implementation lands.
- **One rejection per compilation.** The pipeline stops at its first
  violation, so an agent with several independent defects — two unproved
  subscripts in different functions, say — meets them one compile at a time.
  [DIAG-1] already leaves the order of violations at distinct nodes open, and
  the [diagnostic record](../research/investigations/readable-diagnostics/DESIGN.md#the-record)
  and its one-object-per-line JSON form can carry several. Reporting more than
  one needs the semantic checker to continue past a `CheckStop` without
  letting a later judgment consume an earlier failed premise, and stays
  deterministic. Unverified benefit: validate with a writer trial counting
  repair rounds on programs with two or more independent defects; reopen when
  such a trial or an agent harness shows the extra rounds dominate.
  One consumer is already promised: [ERR-2] says variant addition "surfaces
  site-enumerated edit lists", yet adding a variant to an enum matched in two
  functions reports only the first non-exhaustive `match` per run. Either
  every ERR-2 site of one enum is listed in a run, or ERR-2's sentence, which
  no other rule defines, is amended to what the toolchain provides.
- **Validate the default diagnostic rendering.** Text by default is
  provisional. The [readable-diagnostics investigation](../research/investigations/readable-diagnostics/DESIGN.md#default-format-text-with-json-on-request)
  selected it on reading cost for an agent (the lean OP-4 and FN-8 records
  measured there are 13-17% smaller than their JSON objects) and on the
  familiar summary-line shape, not on a measured repair loop. Run a writer
  trial over a fixed set of rejections covering lexical, grammar,
  canonical-form and proof families, comparing text and JSON defaults and a
  caret marker against a quoted span, with compile rounds to a fix as the
  criterion. Reopen the default, and the marker form, when that trial or an
  agent harness shows a difference.
- **Structured fields for stops that are not source rejections: declined.**
  Resource, invocation, internal-invariant, target-layout and backend stops
  print their stage value's `Debug` text as one `payload` field. They have no
  writer repair, and no consumer reads their fields separately. Reopen when a
  harness or experiment acts on one of them, for example a resource ceiling a
  writer can raise.
- **Text lists are ambiguous when an item contains `, `.** A diagnostic list
  such as `relations: [a, b]` prints items unquoted, so an item holding `, `
  cannot be split exactly from text. The JSON form carries each item as its
  own string and covers exact parsing; reopen only if an agent misreads such a
  list in practice.
- **The entailment fragment keeps a second resolved-place renderer.** Checker
  payloads (EFF-5, OP-12, REF-2) spell resolved places through
  `render_resolved_place` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions/places.rs`,
  while ENT-6 residuals and goals use `render_place` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/render.rs`, which still renders a payload
  step by its variant and field ordinals and a literal subscript offset
  without its `_u64` suffix. One renderer shared through a small naming seam
  would remove the drift that produced the `<binding:N>` leak; the cost is
  touching every pinned residual that spells a subscript or payload. Validate
  by rendering both families from one function with the pinned-sentence
  corpus unchanged except for the corrected spellings. Deferred from the
  source-spelling fix because no current residual reaches either form in the
  pinned corpus; reopen when one does or when either renderer next changes.
- **A computed call argument has no source spelling in an EFF-5 path.** An
  index position substituted from an argument that is neither a literal, a
  const nor a binding, such as `first: indices[0_u64]`, renders as `?`,
  because the checker captures only the value's identity and not the
  argument's text. Rendering the argument's source extent would name it
  exactly; validate that the extent is available at every capture site and
  that capture identity stays unchanged. Deferred because the separation
  proof already needs a binding there and the rejection names the call;
  reopen when a writer report shows the `?` blocking a repair.
- **A few payload strings still carry non-source forms.** The source-spelling
  fix left three: the FN-9 `relation` field prints the normalized relation
  with unsuffixed literals, such as `"w.value - 0 <= -1"` for
  `ensures result < 0_T`; the goal-literal renderer in
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/flow/render.rs` falls back to
  `format!("{other:?}")` for a value it has no source form for, such as an
  array or struct constant; and the SET-1 `InvalidSetTarget` payload prints
  `root_class: format!("{class:?}")`, a resolver class name. Render each in
  its source form, the relation through the same normalized-relation
  renderer with suffixed literals; validate by the pinned-sentence corpus,
  whose only change is the corrected spellings. Deferred because each needs
  its own rendering decision and none blocked the reported repairs; close
  when all three print source forms.

- **A directory named through a symbolic link cannot be opened.**
  `open_directory` opens one component without following a link, which the
  walk relies on to leave enumerated links alone, and the prelude has no
  directory open over a `RelativePath`; `open_read` follows links but opens
  only regular files. So `wfgrep PATTERN ROOT` reports a root that is, or
  passes through, a link to a directory as `cannot read`, where `grep -r`
  follows a link named on its command line. Lifting it needs a prelude
  addition, a directory open over a `RelativePath` resolved as `open_read`
  resolves it, so it is a specification change deferred from the wfgrep root
  fix. Validate with a wfgrep case whose root and whose middle root component
  are links while an enumerated link stays unfollowed. Reopen when a program
  must walk a user-named linked directory.

- **`tests/programs/dir_walk.wf` truncates silently past its fixture.** It
  collects into constant-capacity frame storage and stops recording after 64
  entries in the whole walk, stops descending at depth 8, and clips a path at
  126 bytes, all while exiting 0, although its doc says it records every
  entry. Its one corpus case walks a three-level tree, so no check depends on
  the bounds. Either report each bound or collect through growable storage as
  `wfgrep.wf` now does; reopen when the program is pointed at a larger tree or
  its constant-capacity form stops being the point of the case.

- **A callee in another module is named without the path the call wrote.**
  FN-8's `concrete_callee` renders a callee as its declaration name with its
  instance arguments (`render_function_instance` in
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/expressions.rs`), so a refuted call written
  `stats::take(counter: &counter, amount: 12_u64)` through a module alias
  prints `concrete_callee: take`. Two modules may each declare `take`
  [MOD-5], so the name alone is ambiguous; the `requires_clause` location
  points at the declaring record, but the payload does not give the spelling
  the call wrote. Render the callee from the call's written callee path,
  alias or `pkg::` prefix included, wherever a payload names a called
  function; validate with a two-module probe in which both modules declare
  the callee's name. Deferred because the location already locates the
  declaration and the change reaches every payload that names a callee;
  reopen when diagnostics for modules are next revised or an agent report
  shows the ambiguity.

- **FN-9 prints its relation in normalized form.** [DIAG-1] fixes the FN-9
  payload as the instantiated normalized relation, so `ensures result <
  10_u64` failing at `return 20_u64;` prints `relation: 20 - 10 <= -1`,
  without type suffixes and with the comparison rewritten as an L0 bound; an
  agent has to translate it back to the clause it wrote. Printing the clause
  with the returned value substituted, `20_u64 < 10_u64`, beside or in place
  of the normalized form would read as written, and needs a DIAG-1 payload
  amendment plus the tests that pin the relation. Validate on the FN-9 probes
  of the [repair-wording investigation](../research/investigations/repair-wording/DESIGN.md#probes)
  and its writer trial; reopen when that work changes the FN-9 payload or a
  writer report shows the normalized form costing a round.

- **Compiler comments cite the retired DIAG-3.** DIAG-3 was the v0.39 runtime
  claim-trap record, retired with claims in v0.40, yet four comments still
  cite it: three for words that are now [DIAG-1]'s (byte identity only where
  selection and encoding are fixed, and the `unproved` or `refuted`
  disposition) in `compiler/src/driver/pinned_sentences.rs`,
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/postconditions.rs` and
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/requires.rs`, and one, the module doc of
  `compiler/src/semantic/permission_ledger.rs`, for the retired record
  itself. A reader following the reference finds no rule. Cite DIAG-1 in the
  first three and drop the ledger's clause; reopen with the next edit of any
  of these files.

- **The callee-`ensures` route can name a call whose result no longer
  reaches the goal.** `call_results` in `compiler/src/semantic/check/repairs.rs`
  traces the values a goal reads back to call results through a closure that
  ignores control flow and intervening writes. In
  `ent5-neg-readonly-field-callee-writes-base`, the loop bound
  `entries[1_u64].width` traces to the `make_entry` call that filled
  `entries`, although the element that reaches the goal was replaced through
  `widen`'s separate `make_entry` call, whose result a statement writes into
  storage without binding it. No `ensures` on `make_entry` relates that width
  to `cells.len`, so the route cannot be carried out there, while the guard
  printed beside it works. The route states the condition it needs, so
  [DIAG-1] holds; the repair is only less direct than it could be. Stop the
  trace at a write that replaces the traced storage before the goal, or offer
  the route only for a value bound from a call and not written since; validate
  with that case and the existing callee-route pins, and reopen when a writer
  report shows the route costing a round.

- **The I/O research record and two runtime comments describe retired
  states.** `research/investigations/io-model/NETWORK.md` says the hand-out
  of a may-suspend call to a pool stack landed and serves `tcp_fanout.wf`'s
  peers concurrently, which spawned contexts [WAIT-3] replace; `DESIGN.md` still says
  canonical `make check` stops on a v0.37 `CANDIDATE` identity; the
  concurrency catalog's retired PAR-3 text and staged-loop sketch predate the
  current rule; the join comment in `compiler/src/backend/completion/bridge.h`
  describes pool stacks rather than contexts; the `.wf` programs under
  `research/experiments/io-completion-bench/programs/` use the retired
  `&uniq` and `own Bool` spellings and no longer compile, as do
  `park-on-miss-measurements/programs/grid_split.wf`, the
  `wfgrep-double-walk/shapes/` programs and the programs
  `differential-fuzz/src/generator.rs` writes, so `read-bench.sh`
  stops at its first build and the spawn work measured single-context reads
  with a scratch loop instead
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 10.5);
  and `.github/workflows/io-bench.yml` says the gate compiles those programs,
  which it does not. A reader following any of them is misled about what
  runs. Mark the research passages
  superseded with a pointer to `WAITS.md`, rewrite the `bridge.h` comment
  against the context scheduler, and either migrate the benchmark programs
  and wire their compilation or delete them with the workflow sentence;
  reopen with the next edit of any of these files or before the next
  read-path measurement.

- **A reserved spelling used as a name does not say it is reserved.** The
  Snowghost renderer's writers found by trial that `copy`, `is` and `checked`
  cannot name a binder [FORM-3]: `let copy = 1_u8;` and `let is = 1_u8;` stop
  as a grammar `UnexpectedToken` expecting an IDENT at `copy`, and
  `let checked = 1_u8;` as `ReservedName` with `class: ModeWord` and an
  inventory ordinal, and neither says that the spelling is a fixed atom or a
  mode word nor which grammar uses it (`capability_bound`, `result_route`,
  the OPNAME and `infix_op` suffixes). The rejection should name the
  reservation and the production that owns the spelling, with a repair to
  choose another name. Validate with a pinned probe per reservation class,
  fixed atom and mode word, in a `let`, a parameter and a field, reading
  that a writer renames on the first round. Reopen with the next change to
  FORM-3 attribution or name reservation.

- **A runtime-formed relative path with several components cannot be
  opened.** `std::fs::relative_path` takes only a `HostString`, which a
  program receives as an argument, and `open_directory` and `open_file`
  open one component each while refusing a symbolic link at every
  component, so a program cannot open `a/b/c` from bytes it read at run
  time, such as a file named in data, when a directory on that path is or
  passes through a link. The Snowghost renderer met this reading resources
  named in its input; the related root case is the linked-directory item
  above. Lifting it needs a specification change: a `RelativePath` formed
  from bytes, validated as `relative_path` validates a `HostString`, or a
  multi-component open that follows links as `open_read` does. Validate with
  a program that reads a path from a file and opens it below a directory
  holding a link, with an enumerated link left unfollowed. Reopen when a
  program must open data-named files below linked directories.

- **Files can only be appended.** `std::fs` opens a file for appending,
  appends, syncs and closes it [PRE-2], and has no positioned write,
  truncation, rename, removal, directory creation, directory sync, create rule
  other than create-if-missing, or way to descend into a subdirectory for
  writing. A program cannot rewrite a log compactly, as Redis's
  `BGREWRITEAOF` writes a new file, syncs it, renames it over the old one and
  syncs the directory, nor clean up a file it made; the append-only surface
  was chosen as the one the persistent programs in view needed
  (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`, "Writable
  directories and append-only files"). Each addition is a specification
  change to `std::fs` taking the write half. Validate with a program that
  rewrites its log through a new file and a rename, and survives being
  stopped between the two steps with one of the two files whole. Reopen when
  a program must rewrite or remove what it wrote.

- **A clock's readings cannot be replaced for a test.** `now` and the
  deadline heap read the host's monotonic clock, so a program's behavior at
  a deadline is tested by waiting for it: the deadline programs and cases
  sleep for tens of milliseconds and cannot show an order of events that
  needs a clock to stand still. A test build could answer the clock from a
  script, as the completion harness already scripts `wf_file_monotonic_ns`.
  Reopen when a test needs a deadline order that real time cannot produce
  reliably.

  The append gate exposed a concrete relative-timer risk in
  `compiler/tests/programs/support.rs::run_with_late_input_and_settings`:
  the parent sleeps 400 ms after spawning, while `stdin_deadline.wf` starts
  its 50 ms deadline only after child startup. Both deadline tests returned
  exit 10 (the first read succeeded) in a full host-permitted corpus run;
  both passed unchanged in a single-thread isolated run. Baseline and append
  compilers emit byte-identical LLVM for this program. This supports, but
  does not prove, a startup/scheduling race. Synchronize the test's writer
  with the child's deadline/read state or control the clock, then deliberately
  delay child startup to show the asserted order survives; merely increasing
  sleeps is not a fix. Reopen on the next deadline-test change. Preserve the
  failed full-suite observation rather than treating the isolated pass as a
  green full gate.

## Modules and libraries

- **Library capacity ceilings that existed for OP-9.**
  `GrowVector<T, const ceiling: u64>` in `lib/std/collections/vector`, the
  deque and slab constructors' ceilings, and `tests/programs/wfgrep.wf`'s
  line, collection and word ceilings were chosen to discharge [OP-9]'s
  allocation-size obligation, which v0.87 retired; each now only sets a
  saturation or refusal policy that its callers carry as a const parameter
  or a failure path. Impact: every user of these containers chooses and
  threads a ceiling no rule needs, as Snowghost's layout code does with its
  `imin` clamps
  ([layout friction](../research/investigations/layout-friction/DESIGN.md#frequency-2)).
  Change: remove each ceiling that serves no stated policy and keep
  saturation where a program wants it. Validate with the corpus programs and
  conformance cases that instantiate these containers. Reopen when a writer
  next changes one of these libraries.

- **A container operation that takes a callback cannot be called again
  inside its own callback with another callback.** Minimal witness: a
  generic `apply<F, fn visit>` called as `apply::<u64, fn outer>`, where
  `outer` calls `apply::<u64, fn inner>`. The instances end after two, but
  the cycle `apply` to `outer` to `apply` changes the function argument, and
  [FN-6] deliberately refuses every such cycle. firn met it as a
  `hash_map_lookup` on the keyspace whose callback looks a field up with
  `hash_map_lookup` in the hash the key holds; it alternates `hash_map_edit`
  and `hash_map_lookup` instead, which works only while two distinct
  operations fit, and a third level of nesting, or two edits, has no such
  way out. Two repairs are open: a library entry that reaches a stored value
  without a callback, such as a probe that returns the bucket's index for a
  second, bounds-checked access, or an FN-6 that admits a cycle whose
  changed arguments come from a finite set written in the program. Reopen
  when a program needs a third level or two edits nested, or when the
  library's container interfaces are next revised.

- **The standard library has no decimal conversion of integers.** Two
  programs now write their own, firn's `read_number` and `put_decimal`
  (`apps/firn/protocol/protocol.wf`) and `parse_port` in
  `tests/programs/deadlines.wf`, each with its own handling of digits,
  length and room. A program that reads a numeric argument or prints
  a count repeats this, and each copy can differ at the edges (overflow past
  19 digits, an empty field, no room left). The change: a `std::text` entry
  that parses a decimal `u64` from a byte range with a result naming a
  malformed or overlong field, and one that appends a `u64` in decimal into a
  byte window it reports room for; then the two copies move to them.
  Reopen when the library's text interfaces are next revised or a third
  program needs one.

- **Complete the vector boundary witness when comparing independent fields.**
  The maintained GrowVector program checks the shipped vector and behavior
  drains, but does not establish LANGUAGE.md's combined public `tag`, external
  append wrapper and function-kind formal with the complete storage contract.
  The actual vector has only `storage`. Build the specified witness in the
  modular-compilation investigation and check preserved facts after a tag-only
  write versus invalidation after append. This is additional language-boundary
  evidence, not required to measure reuse of the existing vector program;
  reopen when evaluating those independent-field effects or that wrapper API.

- **Finish and qualify the modular incremental design.** The
  [architecture](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/DESIGN.md),
  [source rules](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/LANGUAGE.md)
  and [specimen](../research/investigations/modular-compilation/demo/README.md)
  describe the broader goal. Module verdicts, proof receipts and native object
  reuse exist; composition still repeats structural checking and lowering.
  The owner retired the per-product import implementation after its
  [matched hashing comparison and follow-up screens](../research/experiments/modular-build-cost/RESULTS.md#disposition-of-the-module-product-prototype)
  failed to establish approximately 5% native entry-edit overhead on both
  containers. The independent runtime SHA improvement remains. The complete
  corrected prototype and its dedicated tests are preserved by the linked
  revision; those tests no longer apply to the active compiler.
  Reopen only for a newly requested consumer-boundary experiment: module-owned
  checked results might avoid per-function reconstruction, but their lookup,
  memory and invalidation costs remain unmeasured. Require complete consumed
  inputs, speculative rollback, current composition/target judgments, equal
  fresh/cached results and zero unchanged-library walks. Compare same-source
  paired native and compiler-only costs against equally optimized main, with
  memory, cache history and cold costs; do not count SHA's independent gain as
  an import benefit. The removed prototype's proof-erasing lowering-input
  projection remains an unmeasured alternative in the investigation, not a
  defect in the current compiler. Any future key must retain proof-derived
  allocation bounds, disposition, permissions and physical inputs.
  Further opportunities remain: finer invalidation within an edited module;
  a cold build without a cache, which checks each module and then the whole closure; the impact report,
  which finds each further failing body by checking its module again with
  the earlier ones set aside; ThinLTO's import threshold, which decays along
  a deep cross-fragment call chain and left the innermost step of the
  crossing benchmark's runtime-entry copy out of line (no measurable cost
  there yet; watch for a workload where it shows, and compare import limits
  or grouping); and an executable runner for entries that take other
  parameters than `Inputs` or return other results than `ExitStatus` or
  `unit`, which build only as libraries (`--emit-llvm`). Extract useful cases
  into formal test ownership as each finer mechanism lands; no daily gate
  depends on the research probe or specimen. Compare clean/warm verdicts and
  executables across edits, including changed summary availability with
  unchanged headers, published-field versus private-field changes, hidden
  layout/heap changes, rejected import candidates becoming profitable, and
  failed builds. Measure input-validation I/O, source/proof/planning/
  backend/link work, runtime quality and peak memory separately on the queue,
  GrowVector, wfgrep, SHA-256, a generic-heavy consumer and controlled
  dependency scaling; an exploratory run found source checking and runtime
  construction ahead of LLVM work at current sizes. A source module is not a
  compulsory body/proof/object unit. Benefit: independently verified modules
  for large projects and parallel architect/implementer agents without losing
  runtime optimization; persistence correctness, LLVM integration cost and real
  build/runtime and collaboration gains remain unverified. Reopen structural
  choices when a discriminating control or matched workload fails; remove this
  entry when the complete implementation evidence lands.
  Defer resolved-public-surface CI reporting until
  interface query values exist; its benefit is detecting capability/contract
  changes that a `public` keyword diff misses. Validate same-identity alias
  renames, retargeting and published or private representation edits before
  wiring a report, with no additional approval gate. Named specification
  projections, effect regions, representation-independent model properties
  and mathematical functions remain deferred: they could keep client source
  unchanged across representation edits or express algorithmic models, but add
  abstraction and possibly termination/proof machinery. Reopen for a type that
  must publish a quantity without publishing its storage, or a representation
  migration or contract that makes this cost worthwhile; compare source edits,
  invalidation, interface size and proof cost with published fields, retaining
  deterministic polynomial checking and no runtime proof work. Measure the
  conservative cross-module component rule on real higher-order code; reopen
  it if it withholds postconditions that ordinary programs need. A persistent
  LLVM planning adapter waits for warm-build measurements that show stock
  ThinLTO planning to be a material share of edit latency. External-package
  resolution and composition of libraries other than the standard library
  remain deferred by scope; reopen only when selected by the owner, with
  package identity/version/renaming cases.
  Subtree-private independently compiled modules remain unselected; reconsider
  for a concrete privacy consumer that cannot use one module's private
  implementation files.

- **Executable caller synthesis moves reference arguments.** The Ring
  boundary sources above pass checking and emit callable libraries, but
  [caller_source](../compiler/src/driver/launcher.rs) spells their generated
  call as `main(window: move window)` and reports OWN-1 `MoveOfCopy` for its
  own reference argument. This is a tool-generated caller defect, not a
  source rejection. A minimal follow-up source without a requirement is:

  ```wf
  fn main(value: &u64) -> result: unit reads(value) {
    return unit;
  }
  ```

  Derive argument transfer from the checked parameter mode and capability,
  retaining ordinary contract checks and owning-value transfer controls.
  The bundled runner currently supplies only Inputs or no arguments; these
  reference entries remain available through ordinary linked calls. Repair
  the synthesized call and its misleading diagnostic without silently adding
  a runner argument policy. Defer from the Ring address-domain probe; reopen
  when caller synthesis or entry support is next changed, requiring this
  reference-copy case to pass its ordinary call check while an unsatisfied
  declared requirement still prevents the generated executable caller.

## Code structure

- **Container performance reports obscure the current conclusion.** The Vector,
  Map and Ordered `RESULTS.md` files under
  `research/experiments/container-representation/` mix many frozen trials with
  current proposals; the Vector report alone exceeds 5,000 lines. A stale
  prospective projection paragraph already linked an unavailable amendment,
  making a refused broad factor look like the current candidate. Reopen at
  the five-family comparison handoff: keep one short current-result map and
  clearly bounded historical experiment sections in the existing family homes,
  preserving raw samples, adverse results, source identities and inbound
  anchors. Verify that each headline resolves to its measured revision and
  that every existing decision/evidence link still resolves. Do not relocate
  load-bearing paths or treat frozen timings as current capabilities.

  The Map evidence bundle also reached 51.42 MiB at f63496c4d, triggering
  GitHub's recommended 50 MiB file-size warning. Each append rewrites a large
  compressed Git blob, increasing repository transfer and retention costs.
  Reopen before further bundle growth: investigate lossless raw-data compression
  and deduplication of repeated source/log payloads behind a reconstruction
  index. Require reconstruction of every original member name and byte hash,
  including failed trials, adverse samples, source pins and replay limits,
  before replacing any representation. Preserve current evidence and links;
  The next matched-C record uses a small ordinary archive linked by the existing
  JSON index, leaving this historical blob frozen; no compaction or evidence
  removal is performed. Keep new evidence bounded in the same experiment home,
  with its existing removal/maintenance owner.

- **Five parallel substitution walkers over a type invariant.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/type_invariants.rs` rewrites the invariant's
  parameter zero with `substitute_goal`, `construct_goal`, `binder_goal`,
  `substitute_relation` and `substitute_expanded`, one walker per
  representation (goal, relation and expanded clause) and subject (a
  parameter or its referent, a construction's operands, an atomic binder, an
  exit state or a result). Each is short and has one caller, so a change to
  the datum shape must be repeated in each. A single substitution keyed by
  subject over the expanded clause, from which the goal and relation are then
  formed, would leave one walker; validate by identical verdicts on the
  `type11-*` cases. Found in the TYPE-11 review; reopen when a new subject or
  datum shape is added, such as a fact at an element read.

- **The entailment state module and its tests have outgrown one reader.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/entailment/state.rs` has 7,737 lines, including a
  1,729-line inline test module, and the tests in
  `compiler/src/semantic/tests/entailment.rs` have 10,920 lines and 156
  tests. The flow itself is divided into its sub-contexts and component
  modules (`design/compiler/engine-components.md`), none over 3,200 lines.
  `state.rs` can move its test module to its own file and its dense-closure
  algorithms apart from the fact state and ledger types; the tests can group
  by the flow component they exercise. Validate that each move changes no
  behavior: identical `make check` results and a diff of moved items and
  module declarations only. Split when no open branch has large edits in
  these files; close when both are under 4,000 lines.

- **External helper visibility retains text after inlining.** The
  [native-pipeline attribution](../research/experiments/container-representation/ECOSYSTEM.md#generic-native-pipeline-pilot-completed-negative-result)
  finds externally visible WF helpers outside the complete benchmark-root
  reference graph; 2,212 of the deferred-unroll arm's 5,716 added object bytes
  are in that pool, while reachable callers also grow. Symbol extents are not
  measured linked savings, and the original object-size screen still fails.
  First compare final-link dead stripping with unchanged objects before
  considering root-sensitive emitted visibility. Preserve foreign entry
  points, address-taken callbacks, result-body optimization order and
  cross-fragment ownership; validate native/ThinLTO/full-LTO builds, cache
  invalidation, linked text and same-source runtime on admitted targets.
  No policy is selected. Defer beyond the code-only pilot; reopen when
  evaluating a concrete inlining/footprint tradeoff or native export boundary.
  The [fresh-insertion linkage screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-insertion-linkage-result-memory-boundary-remains)
  internalizes four closed-witness instances but leaves scalar result storage
  and its caller tag load, with a new wide per-item call. No runtime benefit
  follows. The [four-leaf register-result discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-insertion-register-result-native-success-without-timing-gain)
  now removes scalar result transport but qualifies no gain; all wide controls
  fail drift admission. Do not select an ABI change from native load/store
  removal. The [guarded constant-divisor and cached-reciprocal screens](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#guarded-constant-divisor-ir-dynamic-division-remains)
  both retain reached dynamic division; the source candidate also grows its
  descriptor and computes the fallback eagerly. Neither supplies runtime
  evidence. The [matched post-O3 reciprocal-loop diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#exact-reciprocal-in-the-exposed-loop-mechanism-passes-timing-unqualified)
  later removes per-item division and passes exact arithmetic/owner checks,
  but qualifies no scalar gain despite lower medians; its frame grows 16 bytes.
  Keep setup, live-state/transport and arbitrary-capacity costs visible when
  reopening insertion work against the unchanged range/peer criterion.
  The [matched-C panel](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#matched-c-fresh-insertion-wf-gains-and-c-attribution-remain-distinct)
  separates four scalar WF inline gains from two aligned scalar peer targets;
  C is slower in every scalar cell, with different descriptors/ABI and table
  geometries still limiting causal attribution. Default peer gaps and invalid
  wide controls remain open; do not treat this C implementation as a codegen floor.
  This does not select a production O2 reciprocal policy. Keep callable-result
  classification distinct from enum
  representation and preserve shared caller/callee ABI and body/wrapper order
  if future evidence reopens the existing return-register decision.
  The [direct-Put union screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#direct-put-variants-under-union-lowering-native-criterion-fails)
  has no scalar/wide size penalty under current union lowering, but its reached
  wide consumer adds eager capture, seven payload spills and a 160-byte frame.
  Reopen a general consumer scheduling/form improvement only with independent
  alias/snapshot obligations, no new payload copies and a complete-operation
  gain. The exact source/O3 interaction is observed; no compiler defect or
  universally avoidable cost is established, and runtime remains untested.
  The [separate two-definition inline experiment](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#two-definition-inline-chain-three-scalar-gains-incomplete-qualification)
  qualifies three scalar insertion gains after removing the per-item boundary
  and hoisting state, but only two aligned peer targets pass and two wide controls
  are drift-invalid. The one-definition screen remains a native failure.
  Reopen generally justified call-site selection and complete regression/peer
  qualification, retaining code growth and linked-layout effects; do not
  substitute a function-name rule or revive the withdrawn uniform inline hint.
  The [ordinary O2 threshold and actual ThinLTO inspection](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#ordinary-o2-threshold-closure-fails-thinlto-import-remains-separate)
  separate two blockers: one threshold increase leaves an enlarged caller
  outlined, while the fragmented route does not import the measured scalar
  callee. Inspect import availability and ordinary call-site cost separately;
  the local 330/250 remark does not price the missing cross-fragment fresh
  call. No numerical import budget or production option is established.

- **Machinery with no remaining consumer.** The checker keeps the region
  machinery STOR-8 retired, though every value it produces is empty:
  `compiler/src/semantic/check/type_regions.rs`, the `region_parameters` of
  function and nominal templates (always created empty), the
  `CheckedNominalKind::Box`'s `region` field, a
  call's `goal_regions` and a `CheckedReleaseClass` with one variant; lowering
  now asserts that the first two are empty and ignores the rest. The flow's
  `is_holder` returns `false`, so `EntryImageHolderConsume` is unreachable, and
  `driver::check_module` has no caller. Finalize checks every parsed node
  against its production again, the re-verification `design/compiler.md`
  refuses. By reading, generic validation never takes its early return,
  because the prelude's generic signatures are templates in every bundle, so
  every nongeneric body is checked structurally twice; the cost is not
  measured. Remove each with no behavior change (identical verdicts and LLVM),
  timing the double check before and after. Close when each is removed or kept
  with a stated consumer.

- **Native construction lives in the CLI and repeats in the harnesses.**
  The runtime-unit inventory, object caches, LTO flags and linking live in
  `compiler/src/bin/whitefootc.rs`; `compiler/tests/support/mod.rs` keeps a
  second unit inventory with different staged names, the program and
  conformance harnesses link on their own, and `compiler/Makefile` holds a
  third list. `lib.rs` re-exports modules by glob, so no public item is ever
  reported unused, and the driver's fifteen entry points come in cached and
  uncached twins that drop options: `--graph --check` without `--entry`
  ignores `--cache`. One library module for native construction and one
  request type (the
  [architecture investigation](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p5-driver-and-api)'s P5.1 and P5.2)
  remove the copies. Validate with identical executables and verdicts from the
  CLI and every harness. Reopen when a runtime unit or entry point is
  added.

- **Shared checking identities still retain separate judgment work.** P2.3
  removes the rollback, structural type mirror and discovery replay, but
  symbolic and ordinary views conservatively recheck their selected bodies
  and analyses. This preserves the distinct selector universes and consumed
  callee claims; retained symbolic bodies also remain in checked-program
  metadata while lowering selects only the ordinary view. Whether repeated
  judgment work or retained body storage matters is unmeasured. A later
  consumer could key reusable judgments by substitution, checking context and
  consumed claims, or discard unconsumed bodies while retaining their
  identities. Both changes affect the checker, proof metadata and consumers
  that address functions by identity. Defer this extra cache/projection
  machinery until a compiler-cost investigation identifies this work or
  storage as a blocker; compare cached and fresh verdicts, diagnostics and
  emitted output and measure the saved work and retained memory before
  selecting either change. See the
  [inventory design](../research/investigations/compiler-architecture/DESIGN.md#p23-one-inventory-without-rollback).

- **Syntax views eagerly build the node-path index.** The shared view now
  serves the graph reader and interface fingerprinting as well as checking;
  those first two consumers use tokens and extents but never node paths.
  Constructing their unused path vectors and sorted lookup index adds work
  whose practical cost is unmeasured. Consider constructing that index on its
  first path query within the same borrowed view. This adds lazy cache state
  and is deferred because no current measurement identifies view setup as a
  blocker. Reopen with the next module-reading performance investigation;
  require unchanged paths, extents and fingerprints, and measure whether the
  saved setup work matters before changing the cache policy.

- **Measure the retained emission model's text storage when backend memory matters.**
  Structured LLVM emission retains definition text for fragment construction
  and a rendered whole-module string for existing text consumers. This can
  duplicate instruction bytes; the practical memory and build-time cost is
  unmeasured. Consider rendering whole-module text lazily or transferring it
  to the final text consumer once fragment construction is complete. Either
  change affects the private output/cache boundary and needs unchanged
  whole-module bytes, fragment bytes and cached/uncached results. Defer from
  the structural migration because no current experiment identifies this
  storage as a blocker; reopen when a larger program's backend profile shows
  material retained text or rendering cost.

- **The range judgment keeps its own model of places and aliases.**
  `compiler/src/semantic/range_judgment/world.rs` models locations, moves
  and aliasing for the range walk beside `compiler/src/semantic/places.rs`,
  which resolves places for ownership and permission. The two can disagree:
  the walk first treated a by-value copy of an array as an alias of its
  source, which `places.rs` never does (fixed; conformance cases
  `range2-neg-copy-is-not-its-source` and `range2-neg-match-binder-copy`),
  and `certified_coverage` in `compiler/src/semantic/loop_permission.rs`
  denies a loop whose certificate's walk skipped an access the permission
  survey sees. Deriving the walk's locations from
  `places.rs`'s resolved places, or sharing one access model, would leave
  one definition of what a statement touches. Validate by identical
  verdicts on the `range*` cases and by the permission tests. Reopen with
  the next change to how either resolves a place, or when a range verdict
  differs from what the ownership judgment says the code touches.

## Open language questions

Questions the owner has left open on purpose. None of them is a decision;
each is resolved by a discussion and a tree change.

- **A proof counter has no type without an overflow obligation.** Minimal
  witness: a monitor invariant `produced - consumed == count` over a bounded
  buffer, whose `produced` and `consumed` exist only for the proof and grow
  without bound, so as `u64` fields each increment owes an overflow proof no
  program can give. Ghost state, erased mathematical integers the checker
  reasons about and the lowering never stores, would express it
  (`research/investigations/io-model/CONCURRENCY-MODEL.md`, section 5.3);
  the owner deferred it while spawn was built. Reopen with the first program
  whose invariant needs such a counter.

- **Type invariants stop at the direct struct type.** [TYPE-11] makes a
  struct's invariant a requirement and postcondition of each callable whose
  parameter or result is written as the struct, a construction's obligation,
  and an atomic block's entry fact and exit obligation. A value of the struct
  read from anywhere else, an element of a `Slots<Table, n>`, a field of
  another struct or a `Box` content, gets no fact, and storing one there owes
  nothing, so a function that returns an element must re-establish the
  relation to satisfy its result's postcondition. Instantiating the invariant
  at each such read is sound only once every store owes it, which the
  module boundary of `design/language/checks-and-proofs` permits. Three
  related choices stay open: whether a module-internal helper may take a
  value whose invariant is broken, as SPARK's internal subprograms may;
  whether generic structs and enums may carry invariants; and whether an
  affine invariant (a sum of fields) is admitted through an entry snapshot
  (`research/experiments/monitor-invariants/`). Reopen with the first program
  that keeps invariant-bearing structs in a container, needs a repair helper,
  or needs a sum. The standard library gains nothing from type invariants
  until generic structs may carry them: every `lib/std` collection is
  generic and every I/O type `opaque`. Even then little moves: of the
  priority queue's contract clauses (`lib/std/collections/priority_queue/`,
  interface and body), only `cap <= ceiling`, four `requires`, is a relation
  every value keeps; the rest state one
  operation's precondition (`index < len`, `len > 0`) or its effect
  (`len == entry(len) + 1`), and the maintained programs repeat a field
  relation at most twice. Reopen generic invariants when a generic type has
  a relation every value keeps that several functions restate.
  The [library-Forest derivation](../research/investigations/unique-keys/DESIGN.md#worked-derivation-a-library-forest)
  supplies a generic predicate consumer. Its active route uses explicit
  boundary contracts with checked logical predicates and storage-content
  transport. Validate support invalidation through aliases and interior
  references, generic contract transport, and every promised exit including
  propagation; a partially repaired Forest cannot cross a call requiring
  its full predicate. Continuous validity and simultaneous assignment are
  not prerequisites for that work.
  A stronger lifetime guarantee is separately deferred. The investigation's
  direct-field and reference-helper Pair probes distinguish it from current
  TYPE-11: a legal write can leave unequal fields, and a helper can restore
  equality only on exit. If the stronger rule is reopened, settle its
  observation boundary and test every creation/mutation route, including
  nested storage and intermediate states inside reference calls. Cached
  subtree counts require a runtime-sized update beyond a fixed tuple;
  any unpack/repack alternative for that stronger rule must exclude
  intermediate observations and prove the invariant before republishing.
- **A standard collection restates at every operation that its capacity is
  unchanged.** `ensures queue^.storage.inner.cap == entry(queue)^.storage.inner.cap`
  appears 15 times across the priority queue's interface and body
  (`lib/std/collections/priority_queue/`), and its like 10 times in the
  deque's and 8 in the vector's. It is no type
  invariant, since it relates two states, and the row cannot supply it,
  since those functions write the whole `storage`. A way to say that a
  function preserves a measure, or a row that names the part of a window a
  function writes, would remove most of them. Count the clauses each would
  remove and the proofs that still hold before choosing. Reopen when a new
  collection or a change to window operations adds more such clauses.
- **Remaining value-evidence boundaries.** The
  [investigation](../research/investigations/result-proof-transport/DESIGN.md)
  leaves three related extensions to assess together: borrowed Result
  selection and aggregate/indexed storage, multiple Result destinations from
  one call, and general scalar `give` expressions beyond the existing bare
  atom. These can remove remaining naming/projection workarounds, but storage
  invalidation, cross-result guard identity and evaluated-expression images
  need their own acceptance rules and cost evidence. Reopen when an ordinary
  library example needs one of these boundaries. Validate matched direct/local/
  projected programs, alias and descriptor writes, joins, loop iterations and
  stronger-contract negatives before choosing an extension; do not infer a
  general refinement system from the local-result implementation.
  Conditional fact representation cost is the separate compiler defect above.
  The conversion tests also retain an affine precision boundary: if `index`
  has only an affine image `first + second`, its checked integer conversion's
  saved Result does not preserve that image after `index` is replaced, even
  when a direct access can prove the bound. Conditional contexts carry L0
  relations, not affine value images. Validate whether a real saved-result
  consumer needs that extra relation, using paired direct/saved cases,
  mutation, joins and independent guards, and measure proof cost before
  extending the context; the existing numeric closure alone does not select
  such an extension.
  These language extensions are deferred because the selected ordinary
  local composition rule can be validated without widening the storage or
  predicate vocabulary.
- **Expression composition and canonical source policy.** Reassess mandatory
  three-address computation and intermediate names together with the ban on
  comments and rejection of noncanonical formatting. Compare authoring,
  local refactoring and diagnostic locality on unchanged algorithms and proof
  obligations; assess each restriction's concrete purpose rather than treating
  explicitness or brevity as sufficient grounds. Expression alternatives must
  specify evaluation order, temporary ownership and cleanup, proof invalidation
  and parallel-permission granularity while retaining deterministic parsing.
  Documentation and formatting alternatives must distinguish canonical output
  from the accepted-input boundary and must grant no proof authority to prose.
  No relaxation or authoring-cost improvement is established. Defer selection
  until the syntax review reaches this group; close it only with an explicit
  disposition supported by these comparisons.

- **Independent retention authority remains unestablished.**
  The [multi-object result](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#maintained-composite-correctness)
  establishes a coordinated Slab/HashMap/indexed-heap protocol for both weak
  expiry and retained deletion after both memberships retire. Its independent
  dictionary, expiry-order and owner ledgers cover wrong-store/stale handles,
  both removal orders, reuse and final cleanup; sequential/parallel observed
  images each release all 129 allocations exactly once. The
  [matched comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/indexed-library/RESULTS.md#measured-result)
  grounds the owner's qualified shared-core selection for maintenance, not a
  proven speedup or native parity. The protocol does not protect bookkeeping from
  independently authored mutations: ordinary handles and nodrop tickets do
  not authenticate a Slab or make membership unforgeable, and stable slots do
  not supply surviving references. Defer stronger authority while consumers
  need only the demonstrated coordinated or weak-index contract. Reopen when
  an actual consumer needs independently held tickets or access spanning
  mutations; validate its complete acquisition/release and invalid-use chain,
  ownership cleanup and same-contract native costs before choosing any new
  mechanism.
- **Deque still lacks zero-copy two-span access over Ring.** REF-4 rejects
  every Ring range, even empty and proved non-wrapping ones. The current
  library's slot visitor is not a substitute for a native consumer accepting
  two contiguous extents. A fully initialized Array works for copy elements
  but adds spare-capacity initialization and does not provide arbitrary T.
  The [source analysis](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#ring-range-correspondence)
  identifies the missing contiguous-span interface. An extension needs a
  concrete span consumer, precise empty/non-wrap formation and invalidation
  rules, native-cost comparison and negative wrap/stale-reference cases.
  Defer extension while this library tests endpoint and rebase costs; reopen
  before using it for scatter/gather or another required bulk span consumer.
- **Deque rebase is an explicit new-owner conversion.** Reference-based
  replacement currently loses the exchanged owners' measures; append's
  lower-bound-only contract also lacks the exact sum needed by the library's
  return contract. The current counted take/place conversion supports nodrop
  T without an impossible cleanup branch, but its cost must be separated
  from a two-extent native transfer. The
  [source limits](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#exact-unavailable-source-forms)
  and [cost comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md)
  distinguish interface precision from lowering. Keep the explicit conversion
  for this slice; reopen if a real caller needs automatic reference-based
  growth or rebase dominates its work. Evaluate the already-open affine
  contract question below before choosing a new storage operation; require
  exact length, emptied-old-owner and unchanged element-order evidence.
- **Exact images for non-wrapping wrap forms and lossless shifts.** A
  wrapping add, subtract or multiply whose operand intervals prove it cannot
  wrap, and a shift by a constant that loses no bit, receive their
  [ENT-3.S7] interval and offset relations but not the [ENT-6] affine image
  of the corresponding exact operation. The
  [operation-fact investigation](../research/investigations/automatic-operation-facts/DESIGN.md#42-rejected-alternatives)
  deferred that step (X): no recorded probe needed it, the exact row already
  states the identity, and with the new intervals the exact row is provable
  wherever the step would apply. Reopen when a proof needs the identity and
  the writer cannot use the exact row.
  A width `end -wrap start` computed under the guard `start <= end` is outside
  even that step: the guard is a relation between the operands, and the S7
  row reads only their separate intervals, so the width stays unrelated to a
  range length `end - start` (conformance case
  `ref4-neg-a-wrapped-width-does-not-bound-the-range-length`); the exact
  subtraction under the same guard is the admitted spelling.
- **The two-premise cutoff of automatic affine derivation.** [ENT-6] tries
  zero, one, and two premises and no more without a written certificate. Why
  the line sits at two, against one or three, is not remembered and needs a
  study before it is recorded.

- **A context can neither log nor report back.** Minimal witness:
  `tcp_contexts.wf` with `serve` writing one line to standard output when
  its peer closes. `OutputStream` is `nocopy` and `Inputs` holds one
  `stdout`, so moving it into the first spawned `serve` leaves nothing to
  move on the next iteration; a reference parameter is refused because a
  spawned context outlives its statement [WAIT-3]; and a spawn statement's
  result is released in its context, so
  the starter cannot log on its behalf. A second writer of one standard
  output and the two ends of a channel both fail the sharing rule agreed
  with the owner (`research/investigations/io-model/WAITS.md`, "Sharing
  between concurrent activities"), because the order of their operations is
  observed. The admitted candidates are a context writing an output of its
  own, a record sink whose observation is the set of records rather than
  their order, and a result that the starter joins where it uses it, which
  [WAIT-3] admits as `let r = spawn f(…)` but only for a call whose starter
  can wait for it, not for an accept loop that never ends.
  Reopen when a context-serving program needs to log or report.
- **ENT-3.S6 names only the bound range's length fact.** S6 establishes
  `part^.len = hi - lo` for `let part = &P[lo..hi];`, while REF-4 states that
  every range's one measure equals `hi - lo` and the value-image rule gives a
  formation's length image without a binding. The checker establishes the
  same S6 relation on the range an argument forms at its call (conformance
  case `ref4-pos-two-ranges-formed-at-a-call-have-equal-lengths`), reading
  REF-4 as the entitlement. Decide whether S6 should say so by naming every
  formation, bound or not; reopen with the next amendment touching S6.

- **An atomic statement over several objects.** `atomic a = &h1, b = &h2`
  would change two objects at one point, as `MULTI`/`EXEC` across keyspaces
  or a transfer between two accounts needs. Two handles may name one object,
  and the checker takes `a` and `b` as disjoint roots, so two writable
  references could reach one state. It needs either a form whose handles are
  known distinct or a runtime rule for the aliasing case with a sound static
  meaning (`research/investigations/io-model/SHARED.md`, "Why a statement").
  Reopen when a program needs two objects changed together.

- **A shared object's state must have drop, and cannot be taken back.**
  `Shared<T: drop>` releases its state with its last handle; a `nodrop`
  state, or a program that wants the value back when it holds the last
  handle, needs a `shared_into` that returns the state and a way to state
  that the caller's handle is the last. Reopen when a program keeps a linear
  value in a shared object.

- **An atomic statement's guard cannot be bounded by a time.** A context
  waiting for a guard [SHARE-3] wakes only when another context changes the
  object, and no deadline or sleep races it, so a context that must act on
  whichever comes first, work arriving or a time passing, polls: the Redis
  subset's append-only file writer wakes every few milliseconds to move the
  buffered changes out instead of waiting for them
  (`research/investigations/io-model/TIME-AND-FILES.md`, "What is left
  out"). A deadline on the guard's wait, with a guard-false outcome, would
  express it without polling. Validate with the writer rewritten to wait on
  its buffer with a one-second deadline, comparing its wakeups and latency
  with the polling one. Reopen when a program must wake on the earlier of an
  object's change and a time, or when the polling writer's cost shows in a
  profile.

- **A function that states a range clause cannot be a function-kind
  actual.** RANGE-1 refuses a range clause in a `fn_sig` contract, so no
  function-kind formal can declare one, and a `fn_decl` whose requirements
  or postconditions include a range clause is refused as the actual of
  such a formal, as `whitefootc` reports "a function signature's contract
  states a range clause". Impact: generic code that takes a function cannot
  take a producer that hands back range facts, or a consumer that requires
  them; no program has needed one yet. Change: admit range clauses in a
  `fn_sig` contract, matched clause by clause against the actual's, with
  the formal's clauses owed and taken at the call as a direct call's are.
  Validate by a generic driver that takes `ramp` of
  `tests/conformance/cases/range3-pos-postcondition-producer.wf` through a
  function parameter. Reopen when a program passes such a function.

- **A function cannot pass on a callee's routed range postcondition.** A
  function that returns a callee's `Option` or `Result` unchanged, `return
  move made;` after `let made = ramp(n: n);`, cannot promise the callee's
  routed range postcondition again: the range walk holds a routed fact only
  in a `match` arm that takes its variant [RANGE-2], so the return owes the
  payload fact unproved. The writer matches and returns a new construction
  of the payload, which costs a match and a move per forwarding layer.
  Change: let a routed fact over a location stay attached to it, so a
  return of that location selects and discharges the same route. Validate
  by a forwarding wrapper accepted unchanged and a wrapper that forwards
  the other variant still refused. Reopen when a program forwards a
  producer's result through a wrapper.

## Ownership redesign (candidate x1) follow-ups

Items the owner asked to be kept on this list during the redesign recorded in
`research/investigations/access-effects/CANDIDATE-X1.md` and adopted into
`design/language` on 2026-09-19. None of them is a decision; each names the
condition under which it is taken up.

- **Fixed-resource execution with proved completion — deferred.** Resume from
  the [research checkpoint](../research/investigations/fixed-resource-execution/README.md#deferred-work-and-resumption),
  which preserves the stack, recursion, loop, allocation/runtime and cleanup
  findings, proposals, probes and remaining validation. The goal is no heap,
  proved completion and peak storage within supplied byte capacities; a depth
  cap or `program no_heap;` alone does not establish it. Automatic qualification
  is unimplemented, the diagnostic stack ledger has coverage/geometry gaps,
  and general recursive release can still grow with value depth. Work is
  deferred until this topic is explicitly resumed. Start by rechecking the
  recorded compiler/target assumptions, then the complete acyclic stack-byte
  inventory; preserve unknown-call/alignment controls and exact budget-boundary
  cases. Progress proofs and full resource closure follow separately. The
  checkpoint also retains the consumer conditions for mutual tail transfers,
  general cleanup lowering and total-work estimation; none is scheduled now.
- **Facts a contract can carry (owner, 2026-09-20).**
  Three additive widenings, taken up together, each measured:
  (1) Affine `ensures`. A `requires` may already be an affine relation and
  enters the body as affine premises, but an `ensures` must fit the
  difference-bound template, one datum a side, so `append` and `split_off`
  cannot publish their exact sum. The affine layer [ENT-6] already holds
  arbitrary affine inequalities over immutable value atoms and proves with
  the fixed AUTO families, so publishing an `ensures` as affine premises in
  the caller changes neither determinism nor termination. Costs to
  measure first: AUTO tries every pair of premises, so checking time grows
  with the square of the premises a body accumulates; and a proof chaining
  more than two published facts needs written `use` steps. When it lands,
  restore the exact-sum contracts of `append` and `split_off`.
  (2) A `requires` stating a variant refinement (`p is Some`).
  (3) An `ensures` naming a single indexed path
  (`p.slots^[h.idx].gen == h.gen`), which decides whether a guarded
  pool access pays one load, compare and branch per call.
  Reopen with a library operation that needs one of these facts; retain the
  exact refused clause and its best ordinary implementation. Validate support
  invalidation, aliasing, entry/exit and index changes, ownership outcomes and
  checking cost as well as the runtime check or source work saved. The Slab
  and Deque [source limits](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#exact-unavailable-source-forms)
  remain examples, not an amendment or a claim that runtime state is lost.
- **Custom outcome contracts remain restricted.**
  FN-9 admits exit-state fragment-integer fields of written references, and
  CALL-4 admits selected fields and measures of success payloads. Routing is
  still limited to the success variants of the prelude Result and Option: a
  custom `Inserted / Replaced / Full` outcome cannot directly publish a
  different length relation for each variant. An unconditional insertion
  interval alone does not prove that a failed first attempt leaves length
  unchanged before a retry. Keep exact source refusals and the best ordinary
  interfaces in the [map trial](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison).
  Reopen when a caller needs those facts: compare ordinary re-reads or a
  separate numeric result with richer publication, measuring remaining checks,
  result transfers and checking cost. Validate entry/exit substitution, writes
  through aliases and incorrect variant claims before selecting any extension.
  Defer language changes while the complete map can use ordinary checked
  accesses; no runtime data or ownership state is missing.
- **Affine equality in call requirements has a narrower route than invariants.**
  The [map proof reduction](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  verifies a local equality after a counted loop but rejects the identical
  equality as a callee requirement. INV-1 splits equality into two affine
  inequalities; ENT-6's signed FN-8 normalization lists ordering leaves only.
  Splitting that one requirement into `<=` and `>=` admits the unchanged
  algorithm without runtime checks. This is a specified proof-shape limit,
  not an observed compiler violation. Reopen with contract-proof work to
  assess consistent equality decomposition, including false equalities,
  negative goals, alias invalidation and deterministic checking cost. Defer
  a rule change while the exact paired-bound interface supplies the needed
  proof without runtime or ownership cost.
- **Container replacement and measure transport.** PRE-1's
  `swap` declares writes to both referents and no postcondition; MSR-3's
  placement rules do not include swap. Exchanging two boxed windows therefore
  kills their supported length/capacity facts without connecting the incoming
  descriptor to the new place. Actual values and unique ownership still move
  correctly. The direct map-migration trial can re-read bounds, but cannot
  derive its promised nondecreasing extent merely from the pre-swap facts.
  Reopen with the contract-publication work: retain scalar-only and nested
  owner controls, alias invalidation and input/output swaps, and compare the
  source/proof benefit with checking cost before selecting a general relation.
  The [Deque reference-rebuild probes](../research/investigations/contract-surface/OWNERSHIP.md#deque-reference-rebuild-probes)
  expose a stronger consumer: swapping in the completed backing loses the
  emptied old backing's zero length needed by `free_empty`. An OP-12 wrapper
  instead rejects an unbounded element type under WIN-3 because its target
  may be linear; adding `T: drop` excludes supported elements and still leaves
  its exact length postcondition unproved under FN-9. Classify that latter
  establishment limit against the current rules before choosing a compiler
  fix or a language extension. Compare a general swap relation with measured
  atomic-result publication and possible linear atomic updates, retaining
  no-hole ownership, no implicit linear release, failure-exit rules and
  reference invalidation. Use the existing scalar/boxed/nodrop/unit Deque
  oracle and its exact length/capacity/head contract; no extra runtime proof
  branch may count as the same-contract success. Defer changes from the
  syntax investigation while the owned rebase meets that contract; reopen
  when selecting its reference counterpart. Do not manufacture an impossible
  branch or weaken a postcondition to complete the comparison.

  A separate, **unverified** OP-12 concern is dynamic index separation in
  `set heap[parent] = exchange_owned(held: move heap[parent], other:
  &heap[child]);`, with both indices in bounds and `parent < child`. The early
  `check_atomic_update_row` uses `UnprovedSeparations` before EFF-5's proved
  pairwise check, so it may classify the second write as reaching the target.
  This is a code-reading hypothesis, not an established compiler violation.
  Reopen with a complete affine-owner witness admitted by OP-12/EFF-5, compare
  the direct call with a two-reference wrapper and an equal-index negative,
  and classify the result before changing proof plumbing. Keep this distinct
  from the linear-target restriction above; no source bound or rule changes
  are selected by the PriorityQueue exchange-helper native probe.
- **Conditional measure controls expose a branch-join limit.** A counted-loop control calling a length/capacity-preserving
  helper in only one arm rejects its backedge facts, as do lockstep growth
  under a branch and a binary search that updates `low` in one arm and `high`
  in the other. The [branch-join investigation](../research/investigations/branch-join-relations/DESIGN.md)
  classifies these as the specification as written, not compiler defects: an
  invariant's conclusion is an affine theorem only, the pre-kill closure and
  the join keep only L0 facts, and the join gives each changed binding a
  fresh atom (INV-1, ENT-5, ENT-6). Its reduced sparse-map loop fails for that
  reason and is admitted by capturing the extent before the branch; the full
  loop the [exact controls](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#generic-owning-map-trial-after-the-ring-comparison)
  record as still refused with an explicit extent bridge is written in
  retired syntax and was not reproduced. A prototype that also establishes a
  proved unit-coefficient invariant as an L0 relation admits the complete
  line-break and CSS rewrites; with two midpoint rows it admits loop searches.
  Its [cost replay](../research/investigations/branch-join-relations/DESIGN.md#current-cost-results)
  does not qualify the proposals: HTML tree-building peak RSS exceeds the
  recorded 10% criterion under the invariant projection, and Vector's inert
  control itself exceeds that threshold, so its row-only result cannot be
  attributed to the candidate. Keep the admitted wrapper and captures.
  Reopen rule selection when a real consumer needs the simpler source, after
  attributing memory growth and repeating the affected comparisons with a
  qualified control; retain the original time/RSS criterion and source-rule
  negatives. Reduce and classify the full sparse-map loop separately.

- **Classify the zero-ceiling Map invariant rejection.** The frozen compiler
  identified in the [two-span experiment](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#prospective-two-span-cyclic-probing)
  rejects the migration header
  `invariant home_low: home >= 0_u64` with `INV-1`, Backedge,
  `required_relation: 0_u64 <= home`, `disposition: Unproved`. The retained
  standalone `invariant-isolation/map-zero/witness.wf` instantiates
  `hash_map_new::<u64, u64, 0>` and `hash_map_rehash::<Key, u64, 0>`; its
  included `hash_map/hash-map.wf:313` carries the rejected header. Otherwise
  identical ceilings 8 and 17 admit. Tiny generic-loop and nested `Slots`
  controls admit too, so this is not a demonstrated general failure of
  unsigned type bounds. The [exact sources and diagnostics](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#prospective-two-span-cyclic-probing)
  preserve all forms and the successful span-local endpoint alternative.
  The remaining full-library context prevents a minimal rule-level verdict.
  Reopen during invariant proof work to reduce the zero-ceiling context and
  classify it under ENT-2's implicit type bounds and INV-1's reachable
  backedge obligations before changing the checker. It limits one proof
  spelling; it does not narrow the public Map domain or block the admitted
  source experiment. Defer that separate diagnosis because the five-scan
  experiment already failed its independent native gate.
- **Legacy HashMap research targets reference retired library paths.**
  `research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/Makefile` still
  sets `LIBRARY_SOURCE` to the absent `lib/containers/hash-map.wf`; its older
  normal/retained recipes and allocation expectations therefore do not replay
  against the current ordinary module. The current `ecosystem-*` comparison
  uses the maintained source and is the route for new measurements. Before
  reusing a legacy recipe, migrate its actual bundle, symbols and full-content
  ownership oracle together or mark it as a historical replay tied to its
  recorded revision. Validate both normal and retained executions and exact
  allocation ledgers; changing only the path would not establish equivalence.

- **Owning HashMap has a remaining large-value performance gap.** The
  [matched comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md)
  exercises the actual generic library, including must-consume pairs, without
  requiring one Box per payload. Its compact result and direct enum migration
  improve the original planned sparse source, but the measured 256-byte-value
  growth trace still costs about 1.64–1.69 times direct C with the same
  migration direction, and replacement about 2.09–2.35 times. These are
  complete checked traces, not isolated copy costs.
  In that baseline, optimized migration initializes inactive payload bytes,
  stages live pairs and reads the displaced payload before its tag is used.
  The rejected unchanged-source initialization candidate above reduces the
  measured wide growth gap to about 1.19 times direct C with ordinary helpers and
  1.27--1.29 times with retained helpers, but normal replacement worsens to
  2.26--2.29 times and retained replacement remains 2.16--2.23 times. Public
  owning results still retain transfers. A forwarding follow-up must preserve
  every owner-return path and distinguish code-generation changes from their
  measured contribution; copy counts alone do not establish that contribution.
  Dense storage remains faster for wide growth but adds reserved metadata and
  dependent lookup, while a fresh sparse rehash retains two complete backings.
  The ordinary index-chain prototype cannot replace the current public map
  unchanged: [its interface](../lib/std/collections/hash_map/module.wfm)
  exposes `cells: Box<Slots<HashMapSlot<K, V>>>` and `vacated`, while the
  [prototype](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#full-operation-index-chain-correctness-discriminator)
  stores separate heads and dense entries.
  Its seven vacated-count mismatches and one capacity mismatch follow from
  dropping physical tombstones and the filled-plus-vacated pressure rule;
  merely adding a counter would not identify which tombstone an insertion
  reuses. Its wide replacement also loses to the current flat candidate, and
  its growth still expands the dense entry backing when capacity rises beyond
  that backing's reserve. Reopen a chain replacement only with a separately
  chosen public-shape change or a compatible occupancy representation, then
  check all public fields, policy stages, owner cleanup, wide mutation and
  reserve together.
  Reopen for a workload dominated by these costs, preserving full backing and
  peak bytes, hash/load policy, retained helpers and exact cleanup. Defer a
  second maintained representation until that consumer supplies its grounds;
  the rejected compiler trial's optimizer losses and reopening grounds are
  recorded above.
  SIMD-group probing and a general projected-storage benefit remain untested;
  the earlier [native hash-slot study](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/blob/38c28403a2defd0b65b8a2ab2b5e4794315e9940/research/experiments/hash-slot-occupancy/RESULTS.md)
  did not establish a recurring tag-check tax. A working library does not
  close either question or imply a universal native-performance ceiling.

  The qualified [current Rust/C++ comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#size-hashing-and-follow-up-interpretation)
  separates two present consumers. With 3584 entries in WF's 4096 buckets,
  aligned-hash misses cost 7.17–14.65 times the three native maps, while WF
  is faster than direct sparse C (0.76–0.79 times). Native reserve semantics
  and capacity rounding differ; WF's wide steady backing uses 1,114,128
  requested bytes versus about 2.17 MB for Rust/Abseil. The subsequent
  [unchanged-source occupancy sweep](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#frozen-source-occupancy-continuation)
  fixes 3584 entries and establishes complete-trace miss reductions of about
  64% for scalar payloads and 72–74% for wide payloads at 8192 versus 4096
  slots. Its six memory pairs were selected before timing; substantial native
  deficits remain, and six of their 24 path comparisons are unstable. This
  jointly changes placement, backing size and setup/cleanup, without isolating
  a probing share. Next compare a justified ordinary-library probing/layout
  candidate before choosing extra metadata, a second representation or a
  compiler primitive. Keep requested memory and both hash series visible.

  Separately, wide replacement costs 1.95–2.25 times direct C across the
  measured populations/hash series, large wide fill/free 1.50–1.52 times,
  and reserve 1.60–1.63 times, with matching allocation counts and bytes.
  Large scalar fill/free is near parity and aligned wide in-place edit is
  faster than C. These contrasts supply current inputs for unchanged-source
  transfer/initialization/cleanup attribution; they do not reverse the
  rejected inactive-payload candidates above. Fifteen replay comparisons
  remain unstable and are unranked. Defer production changes until the two
  separate discriminators preserve complete returned owners, cleanup, timing
  and memory outcomes without relying on those unstable cells.


  The [isolated reserve baseline](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#isolated-public-reserve-entry-headroom-baseline)
  now verifies future ordinary-put headroom rather than equating raw reserve
  arguments. WF's physical-slot request needs B(T)=floor(4(T−1)/3)+1 to match
  the peers' application entry floor. Aligned large wide growth costs
  121.666/121.512 µs versus Rust 64.215/62.520 and C++ 12.678/12.747 µs, with
  complete owners and exact backing ledgers retained. Only seven of 16 cells
  meet the registered target; three cells have short aggregate intervals and
  one has unstable peer medians. Reopen reserve optimization at its reached
  rebuild initialization, migration and probing work, preserving arbitrary
  capacities, all returned owners and future-put headroom. Require maintained
  generic admission and both normal/collision native paths before timing: the
  source running-index rebuild trial failed the former and traded normal-probe
  savings for more collision work. This does not close scalar replacement or
  select the previously rejected inactive-payload initialization policy.

  The isolated fresh-Vacant zero-store floor also fails its wide reserve
  criterion: aligned S64 overlaps and S4096 is slower in both valid cohorts,
  despite removing payload initialization stores. Preserve the current policy;
  reopen storage or migration changes for a distinct reached-code mechanism
  with complete-content and ownership checks. This result neither attributes
  the loss to cache/allocation state nor rules out every inactive-byte strategy.

  Ordinary-source owner migration retains a narrower performance limit: self-tail scanning
  removes inactive destination capture and Inserted-result clearing, reducing
  simultaneous wide frames from 752 to 336 bytes, but retains 256-byte argument
  staging. Small aligned wide reserve gains pass the supplemental paired gates;
  large raw gains fail the unchanged C++ cohort-stability limit, and both sizes
  remain behind both peers. Establish complete paired qualification for the
  parameter-held owner protocol and measure any further removal of reached
  work with generic ownership and hostile callback checks. Avoid replacing it with
  the rejected backing-slot swap's three full 272-byte transfers.

  Combining that source shape with a scratch fresh-Vacant initialization floor
  gives a qualified small-wide gain, but large-wide overlap/gain and excessive
  Rust/C++ peer drift fail the complete criterion. Preserve both the raw outlier
  and unchanged initialization policy. Reopen only for a distinct mechanism
  with complete ownership checks and qualified large-cell evidence; fewer stores
  alone neither prove the elapsed cause nor authorize generic inactive bytes.

  The old-backing owner-argument floor removes the remaining 256-byte caller
  snapshot and reduces its frame from 336 to 64 bytes, but neither primary
  complete range separates in both cohorts and peer stability fails. It does
  not demonstrate a qualified runtime contribution. Keep source-load/projection
  snapshot behavior unchanged; reopen general forwarding only with qualified
  performance evidence and established lifetime, alias and intervening-write
  conditions, rather than the native copy count alone.

  A distinct zero-preserving [padding discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#zero-preserving-padding-discriminator-native-fusion-succeeds)
  changes four fresh slot constructions to zero their complete allocated size.
  Ordinary LLVM then fuses allocation and initialization into `calloc` for both
  widths; existing tag/key/value zeros, argument staging and copy sites remain.
  The subsequent [generic implementation comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#complete-constructor-zeroing-implementation-comparison-does-not-qualify)
  passes construction, zero-size, ownership and post-optimization calloc
  accounting checks. It also inlines wide migration and removes argument staging,
  so its runtime difference cannot isolate zero-store cost. All eight growth
  cells fail instrument or stability qualification; small aligned-wide raw
  medians worsen while large medians improve. Keep the candidate experimental;
  production selection still needs qualified complete-panel evidence, including
  the adverse small case, standalone extend and whole-module inlining collateral.

  The generic complete-zero constructor candidate also exposes a store-free
  counting loop in fresh HashMap rebuilds after LLVM fuses initialization into
  `calloc`. The physical-index nonnegativity assumption from
  `compiler/src/backend/emitter/runs.rs` survives with the induction variable;
  the final index still feeds migration's probe limit. An equal-pass raw-IR
  discriminator removes only six initializer assumptions: LLVM then deletes
  all four loops and derives the live final index, while the control retains
  residual loops. A source-admitted generic positive-stride Slots append rule
  now removes those loops without deleting assumptions: target qualification
  and len < cap justify signed and unsigned no-wrap flags. Zero-stride lengths
  retain the complete u64 domain. The [combined comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#complete-zeroing-with-bounded-append-scalar-gains-wide-criterion-unmet)
  has four qualified scalar growth gains, but small-wide overlap with adverse
  medians and large-wide candidate/ratio drift leave its wide criterion unmet.
  Keep this implementation experimental; its combined result does not isolate
  the loop's elapsed contribution or select constructor lowering.
  The subsequent [fresh-tag diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-tag-initialization-after-bounded-append-small-wide-gain-only)
  retains the small frame/direct payload transfer and obtains a qualified
  small-wide gain, but loses 12–14 percent on large scalar growth and leaves
  large-wide improvement unqualified. It is not a general omission policy;
  keep the adverse cells, complete transport obligations and peer target open.

  The same ledger/native audit separates the peers' remaining representation
  costs. Rust relocates the same wide payload bytes while initializing compact
  control metadata and scanning/probing it in groups; WF initializes complete
  inline slots and scans strided tags. C++ instead retains separately allocated
  payload nodes and rebuilds bucket links. Reopen initialization and metadata
  attribution against Rust with fixed capacities, full ownership/headroom
  checks and adverse results retained. A boxed-value alternative would add
  per-offer allocation and lookup indirection and change the exposed cells
  type; reserve-only improvement cannot select it for the ordinary map API.

  The [current-policy dense experiment](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#current-policy-dense-storage-wide-reserve-gains-and-scalar-losses)
  obtains qualified small-wide reserve gains of about 64 percent, but scalar
  reserve regresses by about 76–119 percent and large-wide comparisons remain
  unstable. Keep the flat map; this does not select a second representation.
  Dense storage adds 16 bytes per reserved bucket plus an 8-byte header and
  changes exposed fields. Its fixed-layout metadata also requires a schema
  allocation bound absent from the generic constructor; the matched 16384
  ceiling is only an experimental domain. Reopen a dense alternative only with
  a concrete consumer and complete lookup/mutation measurements, an explicit
  public-shape/domain choice, and accounted owning-program allocations. The
  rejected unnecessary loop invariant is retained as an unresolved proof
  observation, not a demonstrated compiler defect. In parallel, investigate
  reductions of the flat map's initialization and transfer costs that preserve
  its scalar behavior; this experiment does not measure those alternatives.

  Extending the running-index source form to `hash_map_edit` removes reached
  native bucket reconstruction, but its [complete EDIT comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#edit-running-index-native-improvement-without-qualified-timing-gain)
  has no before/after cell with separated ranges in both cohorts, despite lower
  medians. Its frozen failed verdict remains unchanged when the Draft integrates
  the same probe algorithm's mask/running-index implementation. Keep remaining
  result staging or probe work subject to the same complete-outcome and peer
  criteria; instruction removal alone does not qualify an optimization.
  The same campaign has only one observation per seed/arm/cohort, so marginal
  ranges combine input variation and execution variation. The later
  [repeated-seed diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#repeated-seed-diagnostic-unresolved-execution-variation)
  retains two median-spread flags among 160 groups and mixed paired ratios;
  it does not isolate execution history, allocation, cache or address effects.
  Reopen attribution with a discriminator for the reached mechanism when that
  uncertainty blocks selection, retaining every workload and peer target.
  The existing experiment and its failed verdict remain unchanged.

  The [retrospective peer-selector correction](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#retrospective-edit-peer-selection-unchanged-verdicts)
  changes one selected peer among 56 cells and no historical verdict. Its
  separately labeled canonical audit preserves the historical stricter drift
  refusals. Historical strict-target Booleans omit an explicit duration guard;
  all observed intervals are at least 3.769 ms, but a future short sample could be
  mislabeled by consuming that Boolean alone. Add a tested duration refusal
  before reusing this reduction for another selection; retain the sub-1-ms
  rejecting fixture and distinguish that future correction from frozen flags.

  The [independent-alignment compiler prototype](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#independent-local-alignment-native-reduction-without-qualified-edit-gain)
  removes three private Result stores on the reached successful EDIT path, but
  its registered timing criterion fails. The Draft's broader eligibility is now
  a provisional implementation proposal, not a revised verdict for that trial.
  Whole-trace frame/instruction reductions include other operations and do not
  attribute elapsed EDIT cost. The separate [EDIT home-mask trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#edit-home-mask-native-division-bypass-without-qualified-timing-gain)
  also fails, including adverse small-case medians despite division bypass.
  Establish the integrated candidate's complete-root, snapshot, overlap and
  parallel-lifetime correctness and retain the unchanged complete-outcome/peer
  target; its conditional API screen remains unqualified as recorded below.

  The [outer EDIT-dispatch caller trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#outer-edit-dispatch-qualified-caller-form-gains-on-large-maps)
  qualifies large-map gains with unchanged library/compiler bytes, but small-map
  comparisons still overlap and miss both aligned peers. The gain includes
  load hoisting and other caller code-generation changes, not a subtractable
  dispatch cost or a container API improvement. Preserve the original multipath
  verdict. Reopen remaining EDIT/result/digest work against the same complete
  outcomes and both peers; any new caller benchmark needs an explicit scope
  rather than replacing adverse results.

  The [Result-materialization interaction](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#result-materialization-and-alignment-in-the-outer-edit-caller)
  falsifies the helper-spelling remedy: a direct match retains the private stores.
  Independent local allocation in the outer-dispatch caller qualifies five
  gain cells, but small aligned peer targets still fail and scalar-large aligned
  qualification is invalidated by C-direct drift. Keep the earlier multipath
  failure separate. Validate the Draft eligibility change against its complete-root
  extent/snapshot/alias obligations and remaining API regressions; do not infer
  per-store cost or a general library gain from this caller-context result.

  The [conditional API screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#conditional-api-screen-no-separated-loss-incomplete-qualification)
  detects no separated loss but remains unqualified: three lookup and one
  mutation cell fail drift checks. Identical address-normalized lookup object
  bodies do not explain that drift or establish linked/runtime equivalence.
  Preserve the invalid cells; reopen their attribution with a fixed-input,
  prospective discriminator before any compiler adoption claim. The
  [new-context EDIT mask](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#marginal-home-mask-with-the-alignment-compiler)
  qualifies four small-map gains, but small aligned scalar still misses the
  peer-range target and large wide is drift-invalid. Its per-key capacity test
  and wide-frame growth remain native costs to attribute; prior mask failure
  and the incomplete regression qualification remain unchanged.

  The [running-index interaction](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#running-index-in-the-combined-experimental-context)
  meets both small aligned peer targets in the combined experimental context,
  but both large aligned cells remain drift-invalid and the conditional API
  screen remains unqualified. Preserve those gaps before any adoption claim;
  reopen large-map variability and required API regressions with prospective
  criteria. The separately rejected unswitch threshold grows whole bodies
  beyond its cap and adds wide hot-loop reload work, so branch hoisting alone
  does not justify that global compiler option.

  Public `hash_map_lookup` already has isolated hit/miss measurement;
  `hash_map_find` is a private helper. Lookup's miss performance gap remains
  open. [Fresh insertion now has an ordinary batch window](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#isolated-fresh-insertion-no-qualified-candidate-gain),
  with no qualified candidate gain and only three aligned peer targets. Owned
  [removal now has a separate hit/miss window](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#isolated-public-remove-scalar-hits-qualify-misses-remain-open):
  four scalar-hit targets qualify, all misses/wide hits fail, and one wide hit
  is Rust-drift-invalid. Reopen absent-probe and complete wide-return costs in
  that caller, preserving returned owners, allocation differences and both
  peers; establish production O2 behavior before generalizing experimental O3.
  The unexplained outer-guard/direct-process wall discrepancy also needs a
  durable timing-boundary observation before attributing that elapsed-time gap;
  it does not replace the independent sample-clock admission. The separate
  callsite-native floor removes the full wide result but retains 144 bytes of
  partial payload spills. Its [fixed paired campaign](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#paired-remove-callsite-floor-no-qualified-gain)
  passes candidate correctness checks but qualifies no paired gain: the first
  control process fails clock admission, seven wide cells fail cohort drift,
  and the remaining wide hit ranges overlap. Reopen with a distinct mechanism
  or a prospectively qualified timing campaign before treating the structural
  result as a speedup or selecting an inline policy.
  The
  [reached wide CHURN remove caller](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#wide-remove-caller-full-return-transfer-already-eliminated)
  already eliminates the full aggregate return transfer, retaining 104 bytes
  of partial scalar spills and slot clearing. Use the new isolated owned-remove
  batch's reached native path before attributing standalone helper copies; retain
  complete owning outcomes, clocks and both peers. This neither selects a
  compiler change nor reopens rejected inactive-payload omission. The
  [isolated public EDIT consumer](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#isolated-public-edit-hit-targets-pass-misses-remain-open)
  now measures integer-fixture hit/miss batches with ordinary public calls,
  complete independent outcomes, off-clock full cleanup and qualified clocks.
  Four hit cells pass the selected-peer target in one fixed campaign; four
  misses fail, including two large misses invalidated by C-attribution drift.
  Reopen absent-key probe work and those invalid cells without dropping that
  control or weakening the registered criterion. Keep the group-metadata and
  occupancy questions open: half-load EDIT does not settle them. The instrument
  does not establish repeatability, generic owning costs or application parity.
  Complete the remaining API gaps in the Map phase with ordinary wrappers,
  independent oracles, qualified windows and the same Rust/C++ target. Do not
  relabel churn or whole traces as per-API completion, or compare the new API
  window with complete-trace ns/edit as a before/after improvement.

  The [EDIT-only two-span trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#edit-only-two-span-probing-rejected)
  addresses the new isolated miss gap separately from the older five-function
  trial, but supplies zero qualified miss gains and three qualified two-cohort
  hit losses; wide-small hit also loses in cohort 1. Keep its source rejected.
  Smaller bodies add a 16-byte frame increment, per-key collision-mode testing
  and a shared hit tail with address recomputation; their elapsed contributions
  are not isolated. Reopen only with a discriminator for reached miss/hit work
  that preserves complete outcomes and all drift/peer gates, not an instruction
  count alone. Original API/application failures remain open.

  The [first-probe controls native trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#first-probe-controls-rejected-at-the-native-gate)
  removes optional-owner/header and repeated extent fallback from continuation,
  but adds a repeated-round count spill and per-key hash-constant materialization.
  Its native gate fails before execution or timing; keep the representation
  unselected. Reopen only with a discriminator that preserves first-hit native
  work and complete callback/ownership behavior, including the extra 32-byte
  descriptor and allocation already at capacity eight. No measured performance
  conclusion or generic correctness follows from source admission.

  The [EDIT-only first-probe peel](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#first-probe-peel-native-pass-timing-rejection)
  passes its narrow native screen but has no qualified miss gain and a qualified
  large-scalar hit loss; large-wide raw losses are ratio-invalid. Keep it rejected
  despite lower large-wide miss medians. Its ordinary capacity-one supplement
  covers a previously missing boundary; promote that sequence into maintained
  tests before any future adoption of this source form. Discarded equality-counter
  IR instrumentation is not qualification. Reopen only with a discriminating
  mechanism that also preserves hit cost and unchanged stability/peer gates.

  The [fixed-hash sensitivity](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#fixed-hash-sensitivity-supplemental-rejection)
  still has zero qualified miss gains and retains hit losses. Three supplemental
  peer-target passes do not replace original qualification; smaller owner layouts
  and changed capacity hoisting prevent pure collision-branch attribution.
  Keep the peeled source rejected and both large-miss drift failures visible.

  The [byte-pack native screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#byte-pack-load-native-only-result)
  reaches one payload load in its bounded consumer. The subsequent
  [mirrored-byte sequence](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#mirrored-byte-sequence-bounded-checks-rejected-timing)
  checks selected metadata/ownership boundaries and predicted allocation costs,
  but has no qualified miss gain or peer target, three qualified two-cohort hit
  losses and two small-miss losses. Its larger frame, per-key hash constants and
  extra metadata allocation remain costs; the early strict native failures are
  not overturned by the later diagnostic. Keep this representation unselected.
  Reopen only a concrete discriminator in the authorized Map phase, preserving
  first-hit pressure, ownership/callback witnesses and full timing/drift gates;
  fewer instructions alone do not qualify performance or generic correctness.
  The [matches-first follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#matches-first-order-native-improvement-timing-rejection)
  also has zero miss gains/peer targets and retains hit losses. Its ordinary
  inconsistent-key witness changes the answer safely; any future order choice
  must state conditional hash/equality laws and extra callback behavior, without
  claiming universal callback-order or termination equivalence.
  The [mask-lowering cost floor](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#mask-lowering-sequence-toy-success-full-map-rejection)
  removes numeric byte reconstruction through an explicit LLVM intervention,
  but still has zero miss gains/peer targets and four qualified hit losses.
  A possible general selector remains unselected and unimplemented;
  reopen only with a reached consumer benefit and preserved source/word-oracle
  checks, rather than projecting toy instruction reductions onto map performance.
  The ordinary-source [masked-continuation trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#masked-continuation-large-hit-gains-miss-criterion-fails)
  qualifies two large-hit gains and four hit peer targets, but its miss-gain
  criterion fails: small misses overlap and both large misses remain invalid.
  Keep it unselected; reopen miss performance with the same full drift/oracle
  gates and account for its worse unmeasured constant-collision native paths.
  The [physical tag-order trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#tag-order-native-miss-dispatch-failure)
  leaves vacant dispatch unchanged while losing all-zero Vacant and increasing
  native initialization/rebuild counts. Do not reopen declaration order as an
  established miss improvement; any new discriminator must address that failed
  path and the module-wide tag ABI. Its frozen status collector is malformed;
  use the retained corrected collector before replay, without inventing lost timings.
  The separate [original-tag Filled-first IR trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#filled-first-ir-identical-native-objects)
  produces byte-identical objects after ordinary optimization. Branch-chain
  spelling alone therefore supplies no dispatch improvement on this pipeline;
  reopen only with a discriminator that changes the reached native policy.
  The separately preregistered [frequency-weighted tag follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#tag-order-frequency-weighted-follow-up-rejected)
  also fails despite source-derived Filled-visit savings: no qualified miss
  gain, three qualified two-cohort hit losses and only one peer target. Preserve
  the original vacant-only failure; any further work needs new reached-cost
  evidence rather than an instruction-count prediction alone.
  The [Robin Hood probe model](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#robin-hood-probe-model-and-tombstone-boundary)
  reduces modeled failed probes, but naive distance stopping fails after ordinary
  tombstone reuse. Reopen in this Map phase with invariant-preserving reuse or
  local restoration, retaining public cells/Deleted/vacated and owned refusal/
  replacement behavior. Screen resident-hash and relocation cost before whole-API
  correctness and the fixed peer criterion; the model selects no algorithm.
  The [saved-vacancy insertion candidate](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#insertion-saved-vacancy-state-bounded-nativecheck-result)
  removes commit-time reclassification but adds per-Deleted flag work and has
  caller collateral. Its [ordinary fresh-insertion campaign](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#isolated-fresh-insertion-no-qualified-candidate-gain)
  now supplies no qualified before/after gain in eight valid cells; default
  peer targets all fail. Reopen reached insertion costs against that unchanged
  criterion, retaining replacement/refusal and dense-tombstone costs. Do not
  subtract snapshot controls or equate their work-unit count with C-ABI calls.
  No source adoption is selected.

  The [actual integrated-candidate comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#integrated-candidate-with-the-maintained-caller)
  has no qualified before/after gain in 40 maintained-caller cells; all four
  overall screens remain unqualified. Its reserve maximum empty interval of
  9,500 ns invalidates every growth cell, while lookup, mutation and EDIT also
  retain drift failures. Reopen clock qualification and those invalid cells
  in the authorized API phase; preserve the failed run without treating overlap
  or no separated loss as proof of nonregression.

  Wide EDIT's ordered digest remains memory-resident because later cleanup
  receives its complete address-exposed value. The [cleanup-boundary source discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#late-cleanup-exposure-native-success-without-qualified-gain)
  removes the reached load/store pair but fails its timing criterion; it is
  not an adopted caller change or a general compiler fix. Reopen storage-lifetime
  splitting only with private-backing, complete-transfer, alias, final-observation
  and target-extent evidence, then the unchanged complete-outcome/peer criteria.
  Per-key dispatch and the unmeasured individual public API windows remain
  distinct costs; do not assign them the elapsed gain of earlier outer callers.

- **Ordered insertion replacement costs need attribution.** Both the
  [aggregate-result candidate](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#single-descent-insertion-candidate)
  and [borrowed-promotion follow-up](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#borrowed-promotion-follow-up)
  regress on replacement despite insertion gains. The second removes recursive
  aggregate clearing without curing the loss. One promotion-slot initialization
  per put, Pair placement/swap/result transfers, occupancy checks and substantial
  stack frames remain; their elapsed shares are not isolated. Avoiding the
  baseline's duplicate miss search and recursive Pair transport remains useful
  only if replacement cost is preserved. Defer another source variant: no third
  candidate belongs to this completed comparison. Reopen when a concrete
  consumer or controlled source/lowering discriminator isolates a material
  cause and supplies grounds for a new experiment. Validate unchanged owner
  identities, refusal behavior and exact release/allocation counts, then the
  complete normal/retained matrix including replacement cells and independent
  control observations. Keep general aggregate-result ABI and placement work
  under the existing compiler items; a different return form alone no longer
  supplies the reopening ground.

  In the qualified current-module native-library series, replacement-only
  at 256 entries costs WF/source C 0.66–0.67 for scalars but 1.41 for wide
  values, with identical allocation records. That payload-size contrast is
  a concrete discriminator for the existing code-generation question, not
  evidence that either rejected insertion form should return. Use unchanged
  source and optimized transfer/stack/loop observations before another variant.

- **Ordered-map occupancy and tree choice remain workload-dependent.** The
  [reserved-storage comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#allocations-and-reserved-storage)
  records 48.6% peak reserved-slot utilization during 4096-pair bundled-tree
  churn, versus 74.6% for direct C; wide peak storage is about 2.37 MB versus
  1.50 MB and native AVL's 1.18 MB. A different repair policy or tree shape
  could reduce vacant wide storage and churn cost. This is one deterministic
  stream, not an occupancy histogram or a measured WF AVL. First attribute
  node growth to split/merge and reinsertion with per-node occupancy evidence;
  then compare one justified alternative under the complete arbitrary-owner
  map contract, including replacement/refusal, range visits, exact cleanup,
  requested/peak bytes and normal/retained timings. Scalar and range tradeoffs
  must remain visible. Defer a second maintained representation until a
  concrete index supplies its governing
  workload; reopen before choosing a default ordered representation or when
  an index is dominated by wide reserved storage or churn.

  The fresh [Rust/C++ comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/ordered-library/RESULTS.md#requested-allocation-storage)
  preserves the same 363-to-562 peak-node growth at fixed cardinality. Wide
  churn peaks at 2,373,888 requested bytes versus Rust's 1,673,656,
  std::map's 1,212,416 and Abseil's 1,453,928, and costs WF 1.53–1.58 times
  Rust and 2.11–2.17 times std::map at 4096 entries. Small scalar costs also
  matter: at 256 entries hit/miss costs 1.66–1.82 times Rust, although WF
  and source C are close. Reopen the occupancy/representation discriminator
  with both sizes and payloads; tuning only the largest wide case can hide
  a different search and fanout tradeoff. These synthetic streams supply
  no real-application frequency weighting and select no replacement tree.

- **Channel primitive.** An ownership-transfer queue in the trusted base for
  producer/consumer pipelines and work stealing; lock-free rings are not
  expressible without it and batched fork-join is the available form. Research
  when the future concurrency primitives are designed.
- **Header-plus-tail heap block.** One allocation holding a fixed header and a
  runtime-length tail (LLVM `User` with its operand list, `sk_buff`). Today a
  boxed struct with a `Box<Slots<T>>` field costs two allocations and an extra
  dependent access; an inline struct plus a boxed tail uses one allocation
  but a wider handle and separated header. An encoded byte block is another
  available representation with codec costs. TYPE-9 still excludes a typed
  runtime-capacity tail inside a source struct; the
  [layout comparison](../research/investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#ceiling-challenges-connected-to-real-source-contracts)
  separates these contracts. Two shapes
  under discussion: (a) a struct whose last field is a runtime-capacity shape
  becomes itself Box-only content, laid out `[header fields | len | cap |
  elements]`, which needs a construction route that knows the capacity, a
  `grow` that moves the whole block, and the no-move-out rule extended to
  it; (b) one more prelude storage shape carrying a header value beside its
  window, built by a construction function taking the header and the
  capacity, which needs no new struct rule.
  Undecided (owner, 2026-09-20: revisit later). Notes for that discussion:
  the tail is always the last field and always one of the runtime-capacity
  shapes; a `Slots` or `Ring` tail starts empty, an `Array` tail does not
  (it needs a fill value and a count); a construction sketch is
  `box_new_tail::<Message>(value: Message(kind: 1_u8, flags: 0_u8, body: _),
  capacity: n)`, where the capacity is an argument of the boxing function,
  the expression with the hole is admitted only as that argument because
  such a struct is never a local value, and `_` would be a new token
  (`..` exists already as the destructuring rest marker).
  Reopen when a concrete typed-header/tail consumer needs the compact owning
  handle or adjacent layout. Compare full allocation bytes, dependent accesses,
  initialization, movement/growth and cleanup against both ordinary alternatives;
  no new layout or construction spelling is selected without that evidence.
- **HashMap bucket indexing.** ENT-3.S7's [tested unsigned operand bounds](../tests/conformance/cases/ent3-pos-stage8b-bit-sources.wf)
  already derive `iand(x, c - 1) < c` for positive `c`. The
  [query-only comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#paired-lookup-results-and-remaining-gap)
  admits ordinary source using a power-of-two mask with the exact modulo
  fallback and confirms removal of division on that native path. It improves
  small-table hits, but the large-table miss is unstable across cohorts and
  the generic query body/frame grow; the mask fast path is not selected.
  The retained running index reduces bucket reconstruction, but misses still
  trail Rust/C++ at matched half load. The matched C linear-probe control
  separates part of that miss cost from the probing algorithm, and the
  [grouped lookup screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#single-backing-grouped-lookup-screen)
  rejects its tested single-backing group shape for separated hit losses.
  The [normalized-caller retry](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#normalized-mask-retry-outcome)
  removes the previous frame growth and gives separated small-hit gains,
  but still qualifies no miss against the slower native peer; some control
  medians drift. Keep it unselected while the representation comparison
  proceeds. The later [conditional mutation-home mask](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#conditional-home-mask-in-the-source-library)
  gives separated wide gains, but scalar replacement medians worsen
  12.07–16.86 percent while full ranges overlap; unchanged chain drift exceeds
  the registered limit. The scalar direction remains uncertain and the mask
  remains unselected. The separate [prepared capacity snapshot](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#prepared-capacity-snapshot-cost-floor)
  partially hoists count/mask work but qualifies no separated benefit and fails
  its spread/drift controls. Reopen indexing with stable paired evidence on the
  selected complete representation, distinguishing home arithmetic from count
  lifetime and descriptor accesses. Preserve
  arbitrary capacities, non-power-of-two lookup, wrap and empty-table behavior.
  The separate [longer final-peer panel](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#source-mask-final-peer-qualification)
  passes only five of eight cells in both cohorts and fails unchanged-chain
  drift; scalar replacement adverse medians still overlap. It qualifies neither
  the complete native-peer goal nor adoption, and does not supersede the
  earlier short-panel verdict. Preserve both questions and all peer ranges
  when reopening bucket-index selection.
  The [explicit fast-arm spelling](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#explicit-mask-fast-arm-native-stop)
  is admitted but LLVM selects between eagerly computed mask and modulo results,
  restoring division on the power-of-two path. That native-only trial stops
  without timing; another spelling needs a distinct code-generation ground.
  The [first-probe peel](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#first-probe-peel-partial-native-mechanism-unqualified-peer-panel)
  shortens the first equal-hit native path but still sets the available-slot
  sentinel. Its separate full peer panel reaches six of eight strict cells,
  fails both scalar replacement cells, and exceeds paired-spread and unchanged
  chain-drift limits. The linked chain bytes stay equal while their placement
  moves; that is a lead, not an established cause. Reopen a first-probe source
  change only with a complete owner-safe continuation and a stable peer panel
  that qualifies replacement as well as churn; do not select this peel.
- **Packing a byte-comparison mask loses the vector form.** Three ordinary
  `Array<u8, 8>` source forms generate vector comparisons, but packing their
  0x80/0 results into a word becomes lane widening and an AND/OR reduction.
  The [grouped lookup discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#single-backing-grouped-lookup-screen)
  measures an equivalent LLVM vector mask 11–26% faster than its original
  scalar mask; the grouped container still loses on hits and is not selected.
  Reopen with a competitive grouped consumer: compare a general lowering
  improvement against the ordinary source forms, preserve exact byte
  semantics and callback paths, and require executed correctness and paired
  benefit. No new source operation or container layout is selected.
- **Handing checker facts to the backend.** Emitted since the v0.60 port:
  `noalias` (not on `swap`), `nonnull`, `dereferenceable`,
  `captures(none)` or `nocapture` by a build-time probe, `inbounds`, and
  `nuw`/`nsw` on the exact family. A `&[T]` range parameter crosses calls as
  its element pointer and count, and the pointer carries the same facts
  except `dereferenceable` (`compiler/backend-facts`; the
  [range-reference fact investigation](../research/investigations/range-reference-facts/DESIGN.md)
  records the derivation and the removed vectorizer overlap check). The later
  qualified Ring payload-address
  `llvm.assume` is measured in the [Deque comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/RESULTS.md);
  its remaining costs are tracked above. Not emitted: `memory(argmem: ...)` (the
  IR retains per-call allocation bounds and readonly-reference markers,
  but not a complete transitive memory-effects summary; the semantic model's
  EFF-3 `allocates` fact is not itself such a summary), scoped
  alias metadata and `llvm.loop.parallel_accesses` (the emitter has no
  metadata table). Build the metadata subsystem as its own step with a
  before/after benchmark. The scoped [descriptor-versus-payload trial](../research/experiments/container-representation/map-library/RESULTS.md#descriptor-and-payload-alias-metadata)
  has byte-identical native output under equal extra O3 passes; it neither
  establishes a general alias bottleneck nor justifies a metadata policy.
  Preserve its audited access/lifetime premise separately from the manual
  count-snapshot cost floor, and reopen with a discriminating real consumer.
  The [Vector full-growth helper](../lib/std/collections/vector/grow-vector.wf)
  also exposes a scalar-contract case: `len < ceiling` and `cap <= len`, with
  the Slots window invariant, imply `len == cap < ceiling`. The
  [split-payload native record](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/ecosystem-append-growth-split-payload-timing.txt)
  still contains the capacity-above-8192 return guard in the ceiling-8193
  instance. This is redundant source control flow, not an inserted safety
  check; its runtime cost has not been isolated. The later
  [entry-equality discriminator](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#full-growth-entry-equality-registered-fact-transport-discriminator)
  supplies only `len == cap` to the frozen inline-owner IR: both full helpers
  lose their length-versus-capacity branch, while the ceiling guard remains.
  Its single screen still passes only two of six matched cells; the branch
  removal does not meet the append target and establishes no paired gain or
  regression. The independent [post-call preserved-length diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#post-call-preserved-length-outcome-load-removed-append-remains-unqualified)
  supplies `make_room` exit length equal to entry length on normal return,
  rather than F's entry `len == cap`. Both actual append paths lose their
  post-growth length reload without a new runtime comparison, but their
  frames grow from 32 to 48 bytes and only one of six matched cells passes
  both cohorts. This unpaired screen selects no production transport and
  establishes no gain or regression against the earlier screens. Reopen when
  a generic retained relation and a discriminating measured case justify that
  work; newly resolve post-call places, including equal-length whole-owner
  replacement, without retaining stale payload identity.
  Retain and lower proved entry-measure relations generically, with explicit
  support and mutation boundaries, rather than recognizing this helper's name.
  Require a complete target-fact mapping, unchanged acceptance and target
  qualification, negatives for stale facts after writes, and a measured
  before/after result before selecting that optimization.
- **Subscripted integer places as terms.** A place with subscripts is a
  term only when its last step is a readonly field, a measure or a writer's
  own (v0.71, [investigation](../research/investigations/readonly-field-terms/DESIGN.md#alternatives)).
  The kill machinery (offset support, overlapping element writes) serves
  every such term, so generalizing to every integer place is cheap in
  mechanism, but a field updated in place loses its facts at every element
  write whose index is not proved distinct. Measure the effect on closure
  size and checking time on a program that updates element fields in loops
  before selecting it; reopen when such a program needs a fact about a
  writable element field that a `let` copy cannot carry.
- **Readonly-field terms stop at L0.** A readonly field below a subscript is
  an ENT-2 term for comparisons, requirements, copies and counted endpoints,
  but it is no FN-9 relation datum, no INV-1 atom and has no ENT-6 affine
  image, so `ensures result <= nodes^[i].count` is refused and
  `requires nodes^[i].first + nodes^[i].count <= kids^.len`
  gives the body no usable affine premise. FN-9 needs the formal offset
  substituted on both the body and the caller side and an `ensures` place
  judged where it is formed (see the next entry); affine images need their
  kill to follow the term's support, as measure atoms do. Validate with paired published and local cases, a kill of
  each support member, and unchanged verdicts elsewhere; reopen when an
  index-based program needs one of these surfaces.
- **FN-9 relations read a formal subscript as an unknown offset.** A
  published relation over `rows^[i].len` with `i` a formal renders as
  `entry(rows)^[?].len`: the body side and the caller side
  (`call_parameter_place`) turn `GoalProjection::FormalSubscript` into an
  unknown capture instead of the parameter binding or the actual's offset,
  as requirement instantiation already does. Nothing but standing facts is
  provable about that term, so the relation is unusable rather than unsound
  today, but any extension of what can be proved about it would conflate the
  elements of two calls. Nothing judges the subscript of an `ensures` place
  either: ENT-2 fixes where a requirement's places are formed, at body entry,
  but not an `ensures` place's, and `ensures r <= rows^[i].len` with
  `i` unconstrained is accepted. The extension must form such a place where
  its relation is judged, each selected return, with its subscripts owing
  OP-4 there, and state that point in ENT-2. Substitute the formal on both
  sides, judge the subscripts, then add a case whose caller publishes over
  two different offsets and must not equate them. Owner (PR #118 ruling,
  2026-09-25): later, by the same principle at each selected return.
- **Affine premises over a reference parameter's fields do not reach the
  body.** `requires s^.a + s^.b <= 100_u64` over the fields of `&Accounts`
  gives the body no premise that bounds `b + n` after `let b = s^.b`, while
  the same `requires` over value parameters does, and stated over entry
  values tied to the fields by L0 equalities it does too. A smaller case: an
  L0 `requires s^.a >= n` does not discharge `s^.a - n` written on the
  place, but does after `let a = s^.a`.

  `research/experiments/monitor-invariants/` holds both as probes
  (`bank-field-premise`, `field-premise-direct`). The first is the gap of
  "Readonly-field terms stop at L0" for a plain field: affine images of
  place terms need kills that follow their support. A monitor invariant over
  a sum of fields needs it, or an entry snapshot. Reopen with the object
  invariant, or when a contract over a structure's fields needs a sum.
- **Tracked-place offsets with projections are not captured.** ENT-2 admits
  any clause (a) term as an offset, but the compiler captures only literals,
  consts and bare bindings. A measure read such as `table[s.k].len` and a
  readonly-field read such as `nodes[n.parent_slot].count` or
  `nodes^[r^].count` are reported unsupported, never rejected, and
  so is such a place in a contract clause. Capture such offsets with their own
  support (the field place, the reference's referent) and a spelling identity
  that keeps `n.a` and `n.b` apart, so OWN-7 separation and ENT-5 kills read
  them; validate with a write to the offset's field, to its root and to a
  sibling field. Until then, bind the offset with `let` first.
- **Readonly-field offsets.** ENT-2 admits a clause (a) or (c) term as an
  offset. A clause (b) term, such as `nodes[nodes[i].parent].count` in a tree
  with parent indices, is equally tracked by the fact system and would be a
  principled recursive extension; it is refused today (no term) to keep the
  offset rule non-recursive. Reopen when an index-based program needs it,
  after the capture above; validate with kills of the inner element, the
  inner offset and the outer element.
- **PAR-1 proves no window liveness and no index outside a range.** WIN-2
  separates `r[i]` from `r.next` and `r.free` only where `i < r.len` is
  proved, and a range from them only where `hi <= r.len` is. PAR-1's
  footprints carry an effect row's index and endpoints as unknown values,
  and an offset no captured value names as the same value, so a statement
  pair meeting on a part and such an index or range gets no overlap
  permission even when the subscript or range was formed in the compared
  state. PAR-1 also poses no query for OWN-7's index-and-range family, so
  an index beside a range separates only by written literals. This loses
  permission only. Reopen when a program needs it: carry the row's argument
  captures into the footprint and ask the entailment fragment for the bound
  or the ordering, as EFF-5 already does through
  `CheckedCallSeparationPositions`.
- **A kill event proves no two positions apart.** OWN-7 separates two
  indices, two ranges, or an index and a range where the current
  ProofContext proves them apart, but an ENT-5 kill asks only written
  literals and the separations an EFF-5 call recorded in the flow's ledger.
  So in a body that requires `i < j`, a fact over `rows^[i].len` dies
  at `set rows^[j] = move fresh`, and a later read that needs it is
  refused although the specification separates the two; a fact at an index
  before a range a callee writes through dies the same way. Asking the
  entailment fragment only for a fact whose place meets a written position
  under the same base, as event liveness asks, keeps the added proofs
  bounded. Validate with that body accepted and one requiring only
  `i <= j` still refused. Found while adding OWN-7's index-and-range
  family; the gap is older than the family.
- **A call ends a window reference's bound without reading the callee's
  `ensures`.** OP-10 keeps a reference into a window valid while the bound
  it was formed under holds, and `place_back`'s `ensures` carries that bound
  across the call. The checker instead ends it at every call of `take_back`,
  `remove_at`, `append`, `split_off`, `place_front`, `take_front` or
  `grow`, and at every other call whose row writes the window's `last` or
  `filled`, whatever the callee ensures. So `&front[0_u64]` dies at
  `append(destination: &front, source: &back)` although `append` ensures
  `destination^.len >= entry(destination)^.len`, and a slot
  reference dies at a user function declared `writes(window.last),
  writes(window.next), writes(window.len)` that takes one element back,
  places one back and ensures `window^.len ==
  entry(window)^.len`. The v0.73 checker accepted the second, since it
  ended no bound at a user call, which also let a reference outlive a user
  function that took its slot back. This refuses programs only. Reopen when
  a program needs such a reference: after the call, ask the entailment
  fragment whether the bound still holds in the call's exit state, as an
  event asks liveness in its entry state, and end the reference only where
  it is unproved. Validate with both programs accepted, the same callee
  without its `ensures` still ending the reference, and a reference below
  the slot still dying by REF-2's prefix rule.
- **Two range steps are identical only as one formation.** OWN-7 compares
  two ranges, or an index and a range, under containing paths that are
  identical step for step or differ only in index steps. The checker counts
  two range steps as identical only when they come from one formation, so
  after `let left = &values^[a..b];` and
  `let right = &values^[a..b];`, with `a` and `b` unwritten between
  them, a call passing `&left^[0_u64..2_u64]` and
  `&right^[2_u64..4_u64]` is refused with EFF-5 although both frames
  captured the same endpoints. The v0.73 checker refuses it too. The
  specification does not say whether two range steps whose captured
  endpoints are equal are identical; whether the checker proves such steps
  identical from their endpoints or OWN-7 defines a range step's identity by
  its formation is the owner's choice. Validate with that call once the
  ruling admits or refuses it. Found by the recheck of PR #141's
  containing-path ruling.
- **OP-11 admits equal-depth slots under one identical array or window
  only.** The checker also admits them under containing paths that differ
  only in index steps: `swap(first: &outer^[i][k], second:
  &outer^[j][l])` with nothing relating `i` and `j` is accepted by the
  v0.73 and v0.74 checkers. Two slots of equal depth are one storage or two
  disjoint ones, so the acceptance is sound, but the checker admits calls
  the specification's wording refuses, the gap the owner closed for OWN-7's
  range families on 2026-09-26. Decide whether OP-11 states the relation
  the checker implements or the checker requires one identical array or
  window. Validate with that swap. Found by the recheck of PR #141's
  containing-path ruling.
- **Vocabulary no declaration can state.** The `len` of a range reference
  (`&[T]` is a kind, not a type) and the four effect-row part names `next`,
  `last`, `filled`, `free` remain specification vocabulary after the
  measures became declared readonly fields. Find a better home for them.
- **The storage shape declarations are inelegant.** `Array`, `Slots` and
  `Ring` are prelude opaque structs with readonly fields, but the
  omitted-capacity form, element storage and placement still live in the
  type rules, and a constant-capacity `cap` is a field whose value is a
  type constant.
- **Retire the class names copy, affine and linear from the specification's
  prose.** The keywords are the two capabilities `copy` and `drop` and the
  modifiers `nocopy` and `nodrop`; the three class names survive only as
  prose terms defined once in OWN-1 (copy: copyable; affine: droppable but
  not copyable; linear: neither). Rewrite the several hundred prose uses in
  capability words when a specification pass can afford the review.
- **Unmeasured performance claims from the ownership-redesign matrix.**
  The v0.60 port has landed; the current Vector, Slab and Deque comparisons
  establish only their stated operation contracts and toolchains. The earlier
  matrix's costs for data-determined index checks, refused scatter,
  find-then-mutate re-descent and construction into an append slot still need
  current source and native controls where those comparisons do not cover them.
  Reopen the affected claim when a container or systems workload exercises it,
  preserving its ownership, order, overlap and allocation contract and separating
  required source work from removable lowering cost. Defer a broad repeat of all
  eight engineering tasks until it answers a concrete selection question;
  a passing new library does not dispose of the remaining matrix claims.
- **A write refused for a written index parameter does not name that
  write.** After `set index = 0_u64`, a body write `window^[index]`
  under `writes(window[index])` is refused with SET-1's "a reference whose
  declared row does not write this path", and a call passing `index` with
  EFF-2's repair `writes(window)`. Neither names the earlier write of
  `index` that moved the access off the row's position, which a writer who
  declared `writes(window[index])` needs to see. Name the write, and offer
  the repair that keeps the row: read `index` into a new binding before
  writing it. Validate with a pinned pair for each of the two rejections.
  Found while fixing the EFF-2 attribution after a parameter write.
- **A goal over an index no spelling names offers routes that cannot
  establish it.** After `let wr = &rows[k];` and `set k = 1_u64;`, a call's
  requirement through `wr` reads `rows[?].len`, and FN-8's repair offers an
  `invariant` whose `use` steps name the facts implying it, or a guard whose
  condition establishes it. No fact or condition names that row, so
  neither can succeed, while binding the index first, `let k0 = k;` and
  `let wr = &rows[k0];`, does. An index a loop-rebound holder carries, also
  rendered `?`, gets the same two routes, and there forming the reference
  after the rebinding is what works. Select the route from what the `?`
  stands for, and pin each pair with a repaired source that is accepted.
  Found while fixing the completion review of PR #145.

## Verification tooling

- **Native stack sampling loses the append caller across WF frames.** In the
  [bounded Vector diagnostic](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#scalar-growth-attribution-registered-bounded-stack-sample),
  the macOS sampler recovers the WF append body and its libc descendants but
  usually omits the known noinline caller marker. The frozen body saves x29
  and the return address without establishing an x29 frame. This prevents
  reliable attribution under the registered complete-call-chain criterion;
  it is not evidence of incorrect program execution or allocator latency.
  The linked FDE already matches the body stack layout at allocator-call
  return PCs; missing body metadata is not an established cause. Reopen now
  with a known frameless native control or alternate unwinder to distinguish
  target sampling support. A frame-pointer diagnostic changes instructions;
  verify caller recovery and do not reuse its timing as unchanged-code evidence.
  A production change needs an ordinary
  compiler regression and target coverage, not a research-only fixture. Keep
  ambiguous stacks excluded rather than adjusting the profiler criterion to
  obtain a favorable share.

- **The trusted runtime is large and growing.** Every program links about
  20,000 lines of C and LLVM IR in `compiler/src/backend` that no checker
  reads (the scheduler, the completion bridge at 3,871 lines, the hosts' I/O
  adapters, the concurrent map at 1,130), and each language feature has
  added to it: the shared map's first claim protocol let one key hold two
  cells until a review found it
  (`research/investigations/concurrent-map/DESIGN.md`, reuse and a key's
  second cell). The change: keep in C only a few primitives Whitefoot
  cannot state (atomic loads, stores and compare-and-swap with their
  orderings, parking and waking a thread, the host's system calls and
  memory mapping) and write the rest, the map's probing and moves, the
  shared objects' queues and hand-off, the I/O adapters' bookkeeping, in
  Whitefoot over them, so the checker proves their memory safety and
  bounds. It needs the language to express atomics and their orderings,
  which it does not today. Measure each move against the C it replaces on
  the duel and the suite. Reopen when the language gains atomics, or before
  the runtime's next large addition.

- **Nothing checks the runtime's concurrent protocols.** The map's claim,
  settle, move, hold and patience protocols, the shared objects' park,
  hand-off and borrowed holds, the scheduler's queues and the completion
  bridge's wakes are
  argued in comments and exercised by stress tests and mutants
  (`compiler/src/backend/concurrent_map_test.c`,
  `compiler/src/backend/completion/shared_object_test.c`), which find an
  interleaving only when it happens to occur; no model of their states and
  memory orderings is checked, so a protocol can be wrong in an order no
  test reaches, as the map's first claim protocol was. The change: model
  each protocol in TLA+ and check its safety (one holder per key and per
  object, no lost update, no cycle of waits) and liveness (every begun
  statement takes effect [WAIT-2]) with TLC over small configurations;
  check the C itself under the C11 memory model with a stateless model
  checker such as GenMC, which explores the weak-memory orders a model
  abstracts; and where a protocol is small enough, prove it, for example
  in Iris. Start with the map's claim and the objects' hand-off, the two
  the last review found wanting. Reopen with the next change to a runtime
  protocol, or with the move of the runtime into Whitefoot above, whose
  primitives such models would specify.

- **No command renders a program in canonical form.** [FORM-2] refuses a
  program that is not in canonical form, and the compiler has the renderer
  (`render_canonical`, which the canonical corpus test calls), but neither
  `whitefootc` nor a `make` target exposes it, so a writer repairs layout by
  hand from the diagnostic's one marked position. Writing firn's 5,400 lines
  needed a scratch binary over the `whitefoot` crate that rewrites files in
  place. Add a `whitefootc --format <files>` mode that rewrites each file to
  its rendering and fails on one that does not parse; validate that it
  leaves every canonical corpus file unchanged and repairs a file with
  reordered spacing. Reopen with the next program written outside the
  corpus, or when the driver's modes are next changed.

- **Nothing refuses a test that runs a compiled program without a
  deadline.** Every current test that runs a program it compiled goes
  through the owned process in `compiler/tests/support/process.rs`, which
  stops it after 60 s, but a new test that calls `Command::output`,
  `status` or `spawn` on its executable waits without limit again, and only
  review would notice; four such waits once held a local gate for almost
  half an hour
  (`research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#stop-a-program-that-never-finishes`).
  The runtime group's C harnesses, which `compiler/Makefile` builds and
  runs, have only the command's 30-minute deadline. Clippy's
  `disallowed_methods` in a `compiler/clippy.toml` could refuse
  those three methods, with an `#[allow]` at each call of the host C
  compiler, `grep` or `awk` in the tests and at the driver's own calls of
  the host toolchain. Validate that the lint fails on a restored
  `Command::output` of a test program. Reopen when a new test program run
  bypasses the owned process, or when the tests' process calls are next
  reorganized.

- **The design-tree skill's tests also test this project's CI script.**
  `design/skill/test_lint.py` runs `.github/design-review-base.sh` in nine
  of its cases, so a project that copies `design/skill/` gets failing tests,
  although the skill is meant to move to another project unchanged. Move
  those cases to a `--self-test` of `design-review-base.sh` wired into
  `make static`, as the other `.github` scripts do, and keep only the lint's
  own cases in the skill. Validate that each moved case still fails once for
  its intended reason. Reopen when the skill is extracted or the CI base
  selection changes.
- **Static verification uses inconsistent, mutable comparison refs.** The
  root `spec-archives` target hard-codes local `main`; after a branch integrates
  current upstream, an older local ref can report multiple new archives even
  when the PR changes no specification. Local `design-lint` and
  `design-ready` instead default to the current `origin/main` tip: if it
  advances past the branch's merge base, new upstream nodes can appear as
  branch deletions and trigger missing approval-log coverage in
  `make design-ready`, and an upstream specification amendment makes its
  specification half demand a `spec/log.md` entry the branch does not owe
  (reasoned from the code, not yet observed). The first two were observed on the
  ownership-surface research branch; explicit checks against its actual review
  base retain the intended obligations. Select and report one pinned review
  base consistently with hosted CI. Validate old local main, advancing remote
  main, an integrated branch and a real branch amendment; retain archive
  immutability, version-transition and changed-node coverage checks. Reopen
  at the next workflow-maintenance change. This research uses the existing
  `DESIGN_REVIEW_BASE` override for the actual merge base and records default
  failures; it does not change the checks or another worktree's main ref.
- **The host-wide check guard has no queued admission.**
  `.github/run-check.pl` rejects a competing invocation with exit 75; it
  records the current owner but no waiting command. During concurrent
  container and compiler investigations, successive commands from other
  worktrees acquired the released lock before the waiting container stage
  could start. Single-command serialization works, but repeated polling does
  not give a waiting investigation a turn and adds coordination delay.
  Investigate an optional cancellable admission queue when multi-worktree
  contention next delays a registered experiment. Preserve one heavy owner,
  nested-command handling, process-group cleanup and stale-owner checks;
  report queue time separately from command time. Validate three competing
  worktrees, cancellation before admission, owner failure and a nested check,
  with no overlapping heavy children or abandoned queue entries. Do not
  bypass the existing lock while this remains deferred.
- **The corpus stage waits on one serial conformance walk.** Each of the
  conformance adapter's two walks visits every conformance case on one
  thread, 62 s and 78 s on the four-core container where it was profiled, so
  there the corpus stage cannot drop below about 78 s at any thread count
  while its other 91 cases need about 87 CPU-seconds
  ([serial profile](../research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#where-the-time-goes)).
  Splitting each walk's cases across the processors, keeping every case's
  ordinary compiler path and verdict, would bring that stage near its 57-s
  processor bound; the hosted runners, whose stage takes 51–97 s, are bounded
  the same way. It is not the gate's critical path while the unit job is
  longer; reopen when the corpus job becomes the longest or its budget trips.
  This changes conformance evidence wiring, so the PR states it under
  AGENTS.md rule 4.
- **The Windows io-hosts steps have no time budget.** They run without
  `run-check.pl`, so only their step timeouts (5 and 8 min) and the job's
  (10 min) bound them, and the Windows job is now the longest CI job, 230–285
  s, 171–195 s of it the Rust build and program cases step. Run those steps
  under `run-check.pl` once its process-group handling is shown to work under
  the runner's Git Bash, or wrap them in a small timer that writes the same
  budget record, and give them rows in `.github/time-budgets.txt`. Reopen when
  the Windows job grows past the gate's longest job by a minute or its step
  timeout trips.
- **Incremental rebuilds are not gated.** The time budgets measure hosted
  cold builds, but daily work pays incremental rebuilds, 6–25 s per edit
  today. A change that makes them slow, such as merging modules into one
  large code-generation unit, passes every budget. Measure an edit's
  incremental rebuild in CI or in `make check` if daily rebuilds grow past
  about 30 s; validate that the measurement fails when incremental state is
  discarded.
- **One budget per runner class hides slow growth on faster runners.** On
  identical compiler source the ubuntu `check/unit` stage took 123–187 s,
  so its budget, 1.25 times the slowest run, lets a change grow a fast run by
  about 90% before the stage trips, and the overrun may land on a later
  change's run
  ([budget size](../research/investigations/test-economy/time-budgets.md#the-gate)).
  The gate's host record now prints the processor model. If the fast and
  slow runs separate by model, give each model its own budget column, with
  the current one kept for an unknown model, and lower the margin as far as
  the within-model spread allows; validate that a leave-one-out over at
  least seven runs per model trips no build or case stage. Reopen when an
  overrun is traced to a change that earlier runs on faster machines passed,
  or when clippy's variance overruns come more than about once a week.

  The [63f2c0685 Linux unit job](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36757483524/job/110031390661)
  passes all 1,912 cases in 103.51 s, but its 140.87 s build and 244.61 s total
  exceed the 135 s and 235 s budgets. The
  [preceding 52f982 job](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36753958765/job/110019446011)
  has identical compiler, tests and `.github` trees: build 86.73 s, test stage
  70.95 s and total 157.79 s. Both use Rust 1.98.1; their recorded processors
  differ (EPYC 7763 versus 9V74). This is host-variation evidence, not an
  isolated processor-model cause. Keep the tests and budgets unchanged; the
  next published head supplies the next CI observation.

  The [4d6641c45 Linux corpus job](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36791591539/job/110145715292)
  likewise passes all 131 cases, but its 95.74 s build exceeds the 95 s
  budget. The [preceding 61229c993 job](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36789881763/job/110140089314)
  builds the identical compiler/tests/CI trees in 56.00 s. Both use Rust
  1.98.1; their host records name Xeon Platinum 8573C and EPYC 9V45,
  respectively. Test execution also differs, 92.14 versus 66.31 s. This
  extends the host-variation evidence without isolating a processor cause;
  retain the failed observation and the unchanged budgets.

- **Compute build-budget variance repeats maintained performance comparisons.** The
  research/documentation-only revision 212c3a6b3 passes its actual comparison in
  [run 36990984618, first attempt](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36990984618/attempts/1),
  but fails only the budget verdict: candidate compiler 135.1 s against 115 s
  and candidate images 12.1 s against 10 s. Its single rerun passes.
  The preceding
  [cea2c2f48 run 36988911413](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/36988911413)
  first exceeded only the image budget (10.1 s against 10 s), then passed its
  single rerun. These observations do not isolate a host or source cause, but
  repeating the full compiler/image build and comparison to resolve budget-only
  variance adds work without a new measured change. Reopen on the next compute
  workflow change: inspect stage/host distributions, cache behavior and actual
  work before proposing any owner-approved budget increase. Preserve all tests,
  comparisons, failed observations and current budgets; repeated reruns must not
  replace investigation.
  At research-only revision 711a8716a,
  [gate attempt 1](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/37002452057/attempts/1)
  also exceeds Linux lint 46.6/40 s and static 70.1/65 s, and macOS unit
  104.0/100 s and its group 284.6/280 s. The matching
  [compute attempt 1](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/actions/runs/37002456996/attempts/1)
  records candidate compilation 116.3/115 s. These are budget observations,
  not an isolated source cause. One failed-job rerun of each workflow passes;
  retain the failed attempts and unchanged test budgets and gates.

- **Vector append comparisons do not fully balance variant order.** The
  [growth driver](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/vector-costs.c)
  rotates three variants with `(sample + offset) % 3` and reverses the second
  cohort, but seven samples leave unequal position counts. Across both
  cohorts, WF and C++ occupy first/middle/last positions 5/4/5 times each;
  Rust occupies them 4/6/4 times. A position-dependent effect could therefore
  weight the peer comparison unequally; no measured deficit is attributed to
  this limitation. Reopen at the next append comparison: preregister a sample
  count divisible by three or an explicitly balanced schedule, verify equal
  position counts, and retain the same API outcomes and timing criteria.
  Keep the old seven-sample data and verdicts; do not retroactively qualify,
  filter or reinterpret them as a balanced experiment.
  The [fresh-element placement screen](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#fresh-element-placement-registered-append-ordering-discriminator)
  uses nine samples and verifies equal positions for that image. Final paired
  and production comparisons remain open; close this item when they also use
  a verified balanced schedule.

- **Qualify the clock at each container API's individual timing window.**
  The Vector growth pilot on the current macOS host reports 1,000 ns for
  `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and observes only 1,000 ns nonzero read steps, while one
  measured growth call can finish in about 200 ns. Summed sample duration
  alone does not qualify such windows. The same native probe reports 42 ns
  for `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` and observes a 41 ns minimum nonzero step. Vector's
  instrument repair and retained pilot belong to its
  [growth comparison](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#append-that-triggers-growth-correctness-and-native-checkpoint).
  Deque, PriorityQueue, OrderedMap and both Map cost drivers also use
  `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`; reopen their clock qualification when each family reaches
  the per-API phase, and require an observation that rejects an artificially
  coarsened clock. Keep old samples with their original instrument identity;
  this finding does not by itself invalidate longer whole-trace windows.
  Recheck Vector's spare-append comparisons with the repaired instrument before
  declaring the complete append API qualified. Qualify each other family's
  benchmarks during its authorized API phase, preserving the historical samples
  and their original instrument identity.
  The [frozen growth-route spare cross-check](../research/experiments/container-representation/vector-library/RESULTS.md#spare-append-after-growth-exposure-registered-api-cross-check)
  supplies that RAW evidence for the two experimental images: all six spare
  cells pass in both launches and both cohorts of each image, with every real
  interval above 1 ms and zero allocations during spare append in the account
  checks. This closes the clock question for those images, not the unfinished
  growth path
  or a future production implementation. Recheck the final selected append
  implementation if its emitted code changes; keep both paths distinct.

## firn

- **firn lacks what a deployment needs beyond the benchmark's commands.**
  The owner set this stage's features to the commands `redis-benchmark`'s
  default suite sends ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#the-owners-rulings));
  a server someone deploys in place of Redis needs more. Missing, among
  others: `SET`'s `NX`, `XX`, `GET`, `KEEPTTL`, `EXAT` and `PXAT`, which
  firn answers as a syntax error where Redis sets the key; `SET`'s `EX` and
  `PX` beyond 10^9 seconds or 10^12 milliseconds, which firn refuses as an
  invalid expire time where Redis accepts them, since firn keeps expiries as
  nanoseconds; `CONFIG GET` patterns, which firn does not match, and
  `CONFIG SET`, which firn answers as an unknown option for every parameter
  where Redis sets those it knows; a zero byte in a request's count or
  length line, where Redis's search for the line's carriage return stops at
  the zero byte and waits for more input, answering that the count is too big
  only past 64 KB, while firn answers the malformed line at once; sorted-set
  scores that are not integers below 2^52, which need reading a
  decimal to the nearest double and printing one with 17 significant digits
  exactly;
  quoted arguments in inline commands; a listening address other than the
  loopback and options by name rather than by position; `AUTH`, `SELECT`,
  `KEYS` and `SCAN`, `INFO`, `HELLO` and RESP3, the blocking list commands,
  `MULTI` and `EXEC`, publish and subscribe, a random hash seed, and a
  listener that a restarted server can bind while the stopped one's
  connections wait out TIME_WAIT, which needs the runtime's `tcp_listen` to
  set `SO_REUSEADDR` as Redis does. The owner
  sets the list for the deployment stage; reopen when this stage's
  measurement is handed back.
- **A set never shrinks, so `SPOP` walks ever sparser buckets.** `SPOP`
  picks the first filled bucket from a random position, and a hash map keeps
  its buckets after its members are removed, so after most of a large set is
  popped each pop scans many empty buckets inside the atomic statement;
  Redis shrinks its table as it empties. A library hash map that rebuilds at
  four times its pairs when a removal leaves it under an eighth full was
  measured and refused by its criterion
  ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#list-elements-inline-and-maps-that-shrink-results)):
  `SPOP` at depth 1 gained 14% on two CPUs but only 4% on one, while its p99
  fell to 0.32 and 0.58 of the unshrinking map's. The full suite then left
  `SPOP` at depth 1 on two CPUs at 0.87 of Valkey with I/O threads and 0.94
  of Dragonfly
  ([firn](../research/investigations/firn/DESIGN.md#the-full-suite-results)).
  Reopen with firn's next performance work after the scaling stage, or when a
  criterion weighs depth-1 tail latency; the change is small
  (`hash_map_rebuild` accepting fewer buckets than it had while they
  outnumber the pairs, and a check after each removal) and would join the
  growth decision of `hash-map-storage` in the design tree.
- **`SPOP` reads the hash map's buckets.** The library has no entry that
  returns a member at random, so firn's `pick_member`
  (`apps/firn/commands/sets.wf`) reads the map's public bucket array and
  matches its slot variants, which ties firn to the library's representation,
  and takes the first filled bucket from a random position, which favors a
  member that follows a run of empty buckets; Redis samples buckets instead.
  A library entry that picks a filled bucket, as uniformly as its layout
  allows, would remove both. Reopen with the library's next hash map change
  or when a second program needs a random member.
