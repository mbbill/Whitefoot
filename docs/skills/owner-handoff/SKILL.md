description: Hand work back to the Whitefoot owner in the owner's language - decision cards first, then the result, specification revisions and what the work found along the way. Use when stopping for the owner - a task is done, an amendment needs a ruling, or a finding awaits direction. Not for progress notes while work continues.

# Owner handoff

The owner rules on the design and merges. A handoff exists so that the owner
sees every decision without re-reading the work: lead with what needs the
owner and keep supporting detail one step away, in the PR, the amendment or
the investigation. Write in the owner's language; repository artifacts stay
English.

1. **Decision cards.** One card for each amendment awaiting a ruling, each
   finding awaiting direction and each other choice the owner must make, or
   "none". A card is a heading carrying its number, then five subheadings in
   this order, each on its own line with its content below it. Never lay cards
   out as a table: its narrow columns bury the reasoning.

   ```markdown
   ## Decision card #1

   ### Topic
   The question the owner decides, in one sentence.

   ### Current state
   What the specification, design or implementation does now, and the
   evidence that raised the question.

   ### Recommendation
   The choice proposed and what follows from it.

   ### Reason
   Why that choice fits its requirements and evidence, and what it costs.

   ### Confidence (1 to 5) and why
   The number, 5 when the evidence settles the choice and 1 when it rests on
   judgment alone, then what supports it and what could still overturn it.
   ```

   Write the headings and their content in the owner's language. Link the
   amendment or evidence that holds the problem, alternatives, tradeoffs and
   uncertainty. Bring one of them into the card only when it decides the
   recommendation.
2. **Result.** A few lines: what changed, the validation actually run (full
   gate or focused, and the tested revision), what remains unverified, and the
   PR link.
3. **Specification revisions.** Whenever `spec/kernel-spec.md` changed: which
   rules changed, their before and after behavior, and why they were selected.
   A version number or PR link does not replace this.
4. **Found along the way.** A short paragraph summarizing the PR's section of
   that name: what was fixed, what was recorded in `docs/todo.md` and what was
   declined, with reasons, or one line naming the areas worked in when nothing
   was found. The noticing happens while working, under AGENTS.md's "Fix or
   record what you notice"; this step only reports it.
