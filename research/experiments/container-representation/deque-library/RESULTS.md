# Deque library costs

## Current standard-container comparison

The opt-in `ecosystem-*` targets implement [ECOSYSTEM.md](../ECOSYSTEM.md) with
the current [`std::collections::deque`](../../../../lib/std/collections/deque/module.wfm)
module, Rust `VecDeque`, and C++ `std::deque`. The C loop and bulk variants
remain attribution controls. This fresh O3 comparison is separate from the
historical O2 and retained-helper measurements below.

The whole trace stays inside each implementation behind one C ABI call;
there is no per-operation foreign call. The common application tasks are
forward churn, reverse churn, actual growth, and setup plus cleanup. No trace
keeps references into the deque across mutation. All removed owners and all
remaining elements are consumed in logical order and every payload word
enters the digest. Native values are an 8-byte scalar or a 256-byte inline
record, with Rust `Copy`/`Clone` absent and C++ copies deleted. There is no
per-element allocation and no nested-owner performance claim.

Growth (source path 3) fills `count`, then appends `count + 1` further values
and consumes all `2 * count + 1` owners. Whitefoot explicitly rebases its full
ring to that capacity. Rust starts with capacity for `count` and grows through
its ordinary deque policy. C++ deque has no reserve operation and keeps its
ordinary block policy. Native capacities and reference stability guarantees
are not made to imitate Whitefoot. The former wrapped-rebase trace (source
path 2) is still checked for Whitefoot/C, but excluded from native ranking:
it never uses its extra capacity and neither native API promises its exact
conversion. Whitefoot's fixture bounds the original population by 4096 and
the larger backing by 8193.

The independent oracle derives the logical sequence arithmetically without
constructing a deque. Correctness includes counts 0, 1, 2, 3, 16, 63, 256 and
4096; rounds 0, 1 and 3; seeds 0, 17 and `UINT64_MAX`; and both payloads. The
zero-count growth trace still appends and consumes one value whenever rounds
are nonzero. The measured populations are 16, 256 and 4096.

Run the phases separately under the repository guard from the root:

```sh
perl .github/run-check.pl deque-ecosystem \
  make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library <target>
```

Replace `<target>` by `ecosystem-build`, `ecosystem-check`,
`ecosystem-account`, or `ecosystem-measure`. Outputs live in
`.build/ecosystem/`: `configuration.txt` records native flags and toolchains,
`accounting.csv` contains allocation observations, and `measurements.csv`
contains raw timed samples. Keep these with recorded source/compiler
identities. These adapters and targets retire with this experiment or a
maintained successor that preserves its evidence.

`ECO_ACCOUNT` and `ECO_SAMPLE_FILE` override those output paths.
`ECO_WORK` defaults to 1048576 and `ECO_REPEATS` to 7. Each active trace uses
`max(1, ECO_WORK / count)` rounds. A churn round performs `count` pop/push
pairs; a growth round constructs and consumes `2 * count + 1` values.
Setup-cleanup instead has zero rounds and repeats that many complete
fill/drain/free traces. Thus equal work does not mean equal individual
operation counts between path names. Warmup runs every implementation with
one sixteenth of the nonzero rounds or trace repetitions, clamped to one.
Two cohorts rotate implementation order by sample and reverse it in the
second cohort. The CSV records work, rounds and repetitions. Compare whole
trace costs; do not subtract setup or call these isolated growth pauses.
Extend bounded runs where a cell remains too short or unstable.

Timed images use ordinary allocation and omit all observer hooks. Separate
allocation images execute three rounds (zero for setup) and one trace per
cell. Whitefoot/C request, requested-byte and peak formulas are independent
of observed counters; native policies are measured without forcing those
formulas. All paths require complete cleanup and balanced allocation lifetimes.
`requests` includes successful reallocations, `realloc_requests` counts them
separately, and final deallocations are `releases`; native totals must satisfy
`requests == releases + realloc_requests`. `peak_bytes` records logical live
requested storage. `peak_overlap_upper_bytes` permits old and new requests
to overlap at Rust realloc without claiming that hidden allocator storage
did overlap. Both exclude private observer headers, RSS and allocator-resident
memory. `ecosystem-check` requires checksum-corruption and unreleased-allocation
controls to fail and verifies that timed images contain no observer symbols.
No specification rule changes for this comparison.

### Verified correctness and allocation observations

The current guarded build and both correctness images completed successfully.
Each image passed 576 configurations and 2,592 complete trace
executions, for 5,184 executions across timed and accounting builds.
The negative checksum and cleanup controls produced their expected rejection
messages; the target also checked that observer hooks are absent from the
timed image. The allocation CSV contains 120 rows. Independently reading
the CSV confirms equal complete checksums within every application cell,
balanced allocation lifetimes, and the stated peak upper bound; every C
control's allocation columns equal Whitefoot's corresponding row.

The existing O2 normal and retained drivers also passed 432 configurations
and 1,296 executions each, totaling 2,592 historical-control executions with
the current module imports. Their retained-helper call checks passed. This
requalifies those reproduction paths without adding historical-series timing.

A separate scratch mutation omitted the final newly appended owner from the
C growth loop while leaving the oracle and allocation schedule unchanged.
The check rejected it with `independent logical-order checksum`, exit 1, at
`variant=1 path=3 count=0 rounds=1 seed=17 wide=0`. This observes the missing
new owner in an initially empty deque and establishes that the growth oracle
checks the added values, beyond the generic checksum-bit corruption control.
The scratch mutation is outside the maintained driver and adds no timing data.

The preserved [allocation CSV](ecosystem-accounting.csv) SHA-256 is
`0ac88c02c5e9ca9517a584cdb75236a3ce1cc09497c4bd2f1e64ae9c835a2fcc`. These are requested-storage observations
from the accounting build, separate from the timing samples below. Build/check
phase durations belong to the central [experiment record](../ECOSYSTEM.md).

At population 4096, forward churn, reverse churn and setup-cleanup have
identical allocation columns within each implementation and payload, despite
their different consumed sequences and round counts. The table shows forward
churn; both C controls have the Whitefoot entries shown.

| Payload bytes | Implementation | Requests | Reallocations | Releases | Requested bytes | Logical peak bytes | Possible-overlap upper bytes |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | Whitefoot / C controls | 1 | 0 | 1 | 32,792 | 32,792 | 32,792 |
| 8 | Rust VecDeque | 1 | 0 | 1 | 32,768 | 32,768 | 32,768 |
| 8 | C++ std::deque | 14 | 0 | 14 | 37,112 | 37,056 | 37,056 |
| 256 | Whitefoot / C controls | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1,048,600 | 1,048,600 | 1,048,600 |
| 256 | Rust VecDeque | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1,048,576 | 1,048,576 | 1,048,576 |
| 256 | C++ std::deque | 267 | 0 | 267 | 1,060,856 | 1,058,816 | 1,058,816 |

That equality does not generalize to every smaller population. With 16 scalar
items, C++ forward churn requests 4,104 bytes in two requests, while reverse
churn requests 8,216 in four. With 256 scalar items, setup-cleanup requests
4,104 bytes in two requests but churn requests 8,216 in four. Native block
policy therefore remains an observable part of the path, rather than a fixed
per-container adjustment. At 16 scalar items, Whitefoot and Rust forward
churn request 152 and 128 bytes respectively; the large-population ratios
would conceal this small-population overhead.

The three-round growth trace at population 4096 has different allocation
tradeoffs:

| Payload bytes | Implementation | Requests | Reallocations | Releases | Requested bytes | Logical peak bytes | Possible-overlap upper bytes |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | Whitefoot / C controls | 6 | 0 | 6 | 295,080 | 98,360 | 98,360 |
| 8 | Rust VecDeque | 9 | 6 | 3 | 688,128 | 131,072 | 196,608 |
| 8 | C++ std::deque | 69 | 0 | 69 | 210,408 | 70,016 | 70,016 |
| 256 | Whitefoot / C controls | 6 | 0 | 6 | 9,438,096 | 3,146,032 | 3,146,032 |
| 256 | Rust VecDeque | 9 | 6 | 3 | 22,020,096 | 4,194,304 | 6,291,456 |
| 256 | C++ std::deque | 1,572 | 0 | 1,572 | 6,352,872 | 2,113,536 | 2,113,536 |

Rust records one initial allocation and two reallocations per growth round.
Its logical peak corresponds to storage for 16,384 elements for the required
8,193, consistent with the native growth policy crossing that capacity.
Whitefoot explicitly chooses 8,193 slots and holds the old 4,096-slot backing
while rebasing. C++ growth makes substantially more requests for wide values,
yet has a lower logical requested-byte peak than either contiguous-ring
implementation in this cell. Request count, cumulative requested bytes and
live peak answer different questions; none is an elapsed-cost or RSS result.
Rust's possible-overlap column is an upper bound around realloc, so its
relationship to Whitefoot's observed old/new overlap cannot establish a
physical-memory ratio.

### Fresh practical timing

The complete [timing samples](ecosystem-samples.csv) and
[allocation observations](ecosystem-accounting.csv) are preserved beside this
record. They serve the standard-container comparison and remain its evidence
until it is retired or superseded with that evidence preserved. Timing source
revision is `0c3203aa6111f14247aa950e3794e83082d4f29c`. The measurement phase
completed in 49.435 seconds, separate from construction and correctness.
The timing CSV has 1,680 rows and SHA-256
`3787a2e45c30fa4bb2ab2d1f11b852d8e76b87afdc560802ad406f145230a591`.

All measured cells use `ECO_WORK=1048576`, seven ranked samples per
implementation per cohort, and separately executed warmup. An independent
read of the raw CSV verified the complete payload/path/population/variant
matrix, sample IDs, both cohorts, exact checksums, and the shared summarizer's
minimum, median and maximum values. These are fresh O3 controls and native
baselines; no historical sample supplies a denominator.

At population 4096, ranges below span the two cohort medians. Ratios divide
Whitefoot's median by the comparator's median in the same cohort: above one
means Whitefoot took longer. Time is the complete sample, including its stated
rounds/repetitions, setup, all consumed words and cleanup. Path names have
different operation denominators, so neither the time nor the ratio is an
isolated operation latency.

| Payload bytes | Path | WF whole trace ms | WF / Rust | WF / C++ | WF / loop C | WF / bulk C |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 | forward-churn | 1.649–1.649 | 0.979–0.983 | 1.462–1.463 | 1.228–1.230 | 1.231–1.232 |
| 8 | reverse-churn | 3.531–3.636 | 2.712–2.795 | 1.390–1.427 | 1.172–1.185 | 1.185–1.207 |
| 8 | growth | 5.034–5.090 | 1.266–1.271 | 1.391–1.406 | 1.385–1.400 | 1.809–1.829 |
| 8 | setup-cleanup | 1.614–1.615 | 0.865–0.870 | 0.865–0.881 | 1.394–1.407 | 1.404–1.412 |
| 256 | forward-churn | 32.063–32.278 | 0.988–0.993 | 0.936–0.937 | 0.980–0.984 | 1.002–1.002 |
| 256 | reverse-churn | 31.886–32.206 | 0.993–0.998 | 0.929–0.934 | 0.995–0.998 | 0.999–0.999 |
| 256 | growth | 81.414–82.914 | 1.014–1.019 | 0.980–0.982 | 0.991–0.996 | 1.044–1.049 |
| 256 | setup-cleanup | 36.228–36.496 | 0.995–1.001 | 0.874–0.883 | 0.964–0.974 | 0.971–0.972 |

Scalar reverse churn is the clearest native-library gap: Whitefoot takes
2.712–2.795 times Rust and 1.390–1.427 times C++ at population 4096.
Across all tested populations, the Rust ratio remains 2.712–2.795. The fresh
C loop control follows Whitefoot's ring layout, allocation policy and endpoint
composition, yet its ratio is only 1.172–1.185 at population 4096. Endpoint
lowering and native representation/API differences are therefore separate
follow-up questions; the present matrix does not assign either a causal
percentage. Scalar forward churn is close to Rust (0.979–0.983 at 4096) while
still slower than C++ (1.462–1.463), which prevents a single scalar-deque
ranking from representing both directions.

Wide forward/reverse churn stays within 2% of Rust at population 4096 and
within 10% of C++ throughout the tested populations. The same fresh C
controls are close as well. The 32-word ordered checksum is material work
in these cells; closeness here is not a general native-parity or pure data
movement result. Setup-cleanup is measured separately and is never subtracted
from a mutation trace to create an isolated operation latency.

Growth changes with population. Scalar Whitefoot/Rust is 0.614–0.621 at 16,
1.118–1.120 at 256 and 1.266–1.271 at 4096. The wide-value ratio is
0.875–0.880, 1.136–1.138 and 1.014–1.019 respectively. Allocation observations
show different capacity policies and request counts, but they do not isolate
why those elapsed ratios change. At population 4096, scalar growth also
costs 1.385–1.400 times loop C and 1.809–1.829 times bulk C. The loop/bulk
pair changes rebase copying while preserving the application result; a
same-source Whitefoot discriminator is still needed before attributing its
cost to that composition or choosing an optimization.

All 24 application cells and every native/C comparator pass the recorded
sample-length and cohort-spread criteria: no paired minimum is below 1 ms
and no ratio changes more than 10% between cohorts. Individual outliers are
preserved in the raw samples; stable medians do not establish tail latency.
No deque cell needs a longer replay for the conclusions stated here.

### Native-code follow-up: unmeasured endpoint candidates

Read-only inspection on 2026-09-26 used the baseline preserved at
`c75520e9d59d74e19ba158e1cae5f394b3a2d874`; its compiler, Deque library and
measurement sources are unchanged from the timing revision above. The emitting
compiler SHA-256 is
`cb918e191bb344733347e0602171d2ec53bd1d201044fdbc5dd7666468eea0a0`,
verified against the retained compiler, with the recorded Apple Clang 21.0.0
and Rust 1.98.1 settings. The inspected `.build/ecosystem/deque-costs-timed`
SHA-256 is `f4ffd2d0da12d90272702f4619a6de6af25f01c4f3e2d1ce242f79275737574f`;
its pre-optimization `whitefoot-timed.ll` SHA-256 is
`89622404e240d377a5be6e330a631173c1d26babf07c6342f579e0e34dd854f7`.
Use that checkout and emitter with the phase commands above for reproduction;
a compiler rebuilt with changed bundled library sources is a different emitter.

In the final scalar trace symbol
`_wf_deque_library_trace$instance$29cf4bd076d714eb`, reverse churn's hot loop
at `0x10000637c`–`0x1000063d4` stores the new element, reloads all three
descriptor words (`ldp` plus `ldr`), and recomputes the front predecessor.
Each iteration also stores length twice and head once. Forward churn at
`0x100006420`–`0x100006458` keeps those words in registers. Rust's reverse loop
at `0x10000b7e4`–`0x10000b814`, in `_rust_deque_word_trace`, also keeps its
descriptor state in registers. Both reverse loops use conditional arithmetic,
with no integer division or per-element calls. These addresses identify the
hashed image; symbol names locate the bodies after a rebuild. For example,
from the repository root:

```sh
deque_image=research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/.build/ecosystem/deque-costs-timed
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/llvm-objdump \
  --no-show-raw-insn --disassemble \
  --start-address=0x10000637c --stop-address=0x10000645c "$deque_image"
```

The ordinary Deque endpoint wrappers already call only their primitive and
return the required value. In [`runs.rs`](../../../../compiler/src/backend/emitter/runs.rs),
`emit_run_boundary` stores the payload before `move_run_boundary` reloads
the descriptor; its `PlaceFront` arm calls `boundary_slot` again. The final
`_wf_place_front$instance$4c5620a98e7f6ca7` body retains the same reload and
recomputation. This is a concrete lowering lead, not a measured explanation
of the whole gap: the same-layout C control also retains descriptor traffic.

Two proposed experiments must remain separate, using the same caller, inputs,
toolchain, flags and oracle before and after each change:

- **A: qualify one unsigned subtraction.** In `boundary_slot`'s `PlaceFront`
  arm, try `sub nuw` only for `select(head == 0, cap, head) - 1`.
  Admitted placement proves `len < cap`, hence positive capacity; the selected
  operand is therefore positive whether head is zero or nonzero. This proves
  unsigned non-underflow without extending the flag to any wrapping sum or
  unused subtraction alternative. It does not prove `nsw`: a zero-stride Ring
  can have head `2^63`, whose decrement crosses the signed boundary. The
  hypothesis is that this exact fact removes the observed descriptor reloads;
  unchanged final code or no repeatable same-source improvement falsifies
  that proposed benefit.
- **B: capture the placement update once.** Separately, calculate the new
  descriptor words before the payload store and reuse the already computed
  front physical slot as the new head, initially preserving payload-then-header
  store order. Test whether this removes the duplicate loads/calculation in
  the final loop and improves the same trace. Persistent work or no repeatable
  improvement falsifies its proposed benefit. Do not bundle B with A and
  attribute the combined result to either alone.

The [backend-fact grounds](../../../../design/compiler/backend-facts.md)
require the complete target promise and reject broad Ring no-wrap assertions;
A proposes only the positive-predecessor domain. The
[storage representation](../../../../design/compiler/storage-representation.md)
normalizes zero-stride addresses, not logical coordinates. Regression coverage
must retain huge zero-size capacities, head-zero/nonzero transitions, fixed
and runtime shapes, all endpoints, and owned/nodrop cleanup. The existing
`zero_sized_takes_update_slots_and_wrapped_ring_boundaries_once` test already
crosses the signed boundary on its second front placement at capacity
`2^63 + 1`; add its fixed-capacity counterpart and observe both ordinary and
retained calls. Preserve the selected
[take ordering](../../../../design/compiler/storage-placement.md) and
[Deque contract](../../../../design/language/data-model/deque-rebase.md).
Neither proposal has been built or measured. Correctness and accounting must
pass before timing under the central per-cell criterion; growth and close
forward cells remain separate questions. No speedup or design selection follows
from this inspection.

## Historical source-composition evidence

This explicit experiment bundles [`deque.wf`](../../../../lib/std/collections/deque/deque.wf).
It is outside daily correctness CI. `make check` verifies the operation traces;
`make measure` checks them first and writes interleaved timing samples under
`.build/`. Retire this experiment when a maintained successor covers the same
contract and preserves its comparison evidence.

## Contract and criterion before timing

The selected Deque has reference-taking endpoint mutations and an explicit
consuming rebase that creates a genuinely new backing. It does not promise
automatic growth or a zero-copy two-span interface. Compare the actual library
with C using the same header, inline payloads, allocation policy, callback
order, and retained helper boundaries. The additional bulk C control replaces
the element-by-element rebase with at most two contiguous copies, preserving
that conversion's contract. Its difference from the loop C control prices
source composition separately from WF lowering.

The three traces are forward churn (`pop_front`, `push_back`), reverse churn
(`pop_back`, `push_front`), and rebase after a half-length rotation has wrapped
the live window. Churn reuses one allocation. Rebase grows from capacity `n`
to `2*n+1`, preserves logical order, resets the head, drains, and releases both
owners. Every payload word contributes to an order-sensitive checksum. An
independent arithmetic oracle derives logical element order without using a
deque. Timed traces include setup and final cleanup; per-round figures are
amortized whole-trace costs, not isolated operation latency.

The matrix uses lengths 16, 256, and 4096 and 8-byte scalars or 256-byte
`nocopy` inline records. Correctness adds empty, singleton, and irregular
lengths, zero rounds, and wrapping arithmetic seeds. Allocation counts,
requested bytes, peak bytes, and final zero live bytes must match before a
timing is accepted. Normal and retained modes save optimized WF/C IR; retained
helper calls must survive. Element transfers are read from those artifacts
separately from layout and timing. No universal parity threshold or application
frequency is assumed.

A separate `setup-cleanup` measurement uses zero churn rounds and repeats
`32768 / count` complete allocate/fill/drain/free traces per sample. This
prices construction, initial materialization and cleanup together. Rebase at
zero rounds allocates nothing and is not used as a construction baseline.
Setup timings are not subtracted from whole traces to claim isolated operation
latencies.

## Source admission observations

The first caller selected direction inside each iteration:

```wf
let removed = if path != 0_u64 {
  let value = deque_pop_back::<T>(values: &values);
  invariant popped: values.inner.len + 1_u64 == count;
  give move value;
} else {
  let value = deque_pop_front::<T>(values: &values);
  invariant popped: values.inner.len + 1_u64 == count;
  give move value;
}
DequeElement::accept(env: &digest, value: move removed);
let next = base +wrap index;
let value = DequeElement::make(seed: next);
if path != 0_u64 {
  let length = deque_push_front::<T>(values: &values, value: move value);
  invariant restored: values.inner.len == count;
} else {
  let length = deque_push_back::<T>(values: &values, value: move value);
  invariant restored: values.inner.len == count;
}
```

The v0.63 baseline compiler rejected `restored` under INV-1 after both
`popped` assertions were proved. Without those assertions it instead rejected
the enclosing loop's same-length backedge invariant. Independent reduction
classified this as a limit of the written proof formulation: ENT-5's counted
continuing kill removes the earlier equality, and the loop headers publish
affine relations over immutable measure images. Each branch mutation creates
a different image; the same-spelled `popped` assertions do not become one
canonical relation under ENT-6's intersection and INV-1's capture rule. A
direct common equality available to the automatic equality family is a
different case. This does not establish a general Deque interface limit.
The current caller chooses its immutable direction before the complete loops,
removing that proof join. The C traces use the same hoist; endpoint calls,
payload construction and callback order are unchanged. No additional runtime
validation or fake fallback was added.

## Results

The corrected baseline has 6,336 accepted timing samples in
[`measurements.csv`](measurements.csv), preserved at checkpoint `5a5481b1`
before the merge of main `7127bcb6`. Both normal and retained executables
passed 432 correctness configurations, each through all three implementations:
2,592 executions in total. Every execution checked the independent checksum,
allocation requests, requested/peak bytes and final zero live bytes. Retained
optimized IR contains 20 WF helper call sites and 40 C sites across the two
controls.

### Storage and allocation

All implementations allocate a 24-byte header and inline payloads of stride
8 or 256 bytes. Churn has exactly one allocation of `24 + n*stride` requested
and peak bytes. Each rebase trace round allocates both the initial capacity
`n` and replacement capacity `2*n+1`: its requests are `2*rounds`, requested
bytes are `rounds * (48 + (3*n+1)*stride)`, and peak bytes are one such pair
(zero for zero rounds). Setup repetition multiplies requests and total bytes,
not peak bytes. Observer headers and allocator metadata are excluded equally.
These formulas are checked independently for every accepted sample.

### Amortized trace costs

The time column is WF nanoseconds per logical endpoint step or rebased element
at `count = 4096`, including setup and cleanup. Ratio ranges cover all three
counts and the four run/cohort medians. Values above 1 mean WF took longer.
Ranges describe measured cohorts, not confidence intervals.

| Mode | Payload bytes | Trace | WF ns/step, n=4096 | WF / loop C | WF / bulk C |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| normal | 8 | forward churn | 3.204 | 2.283–2.341 | 2.283–2.341 |

| retained | 256 | forward churn | 38.177–38.452 | 0.956–1.017 | 0.959–0.993 |
| retained | 256 | reverse churn | 38.055–38.452 | 0.939–0.976 | 0.939–0.981 |
| retained | 256 | wrapped rebase | 57.190–59.448 | 0.953–0.975 | 0.978–1.030 |

The wide-record workload is competitive under both boundary treatments;
scalar normal-mode churn and rebase are not at native parity. The scalar
rebase loop/bulk comparison exposes a separate source-composition opportunity,
but these complete traces do not price just the copy phase. Keeping the
explicit consuming rebase is useful as a library capability without claiming
an efficient automatic growth policy or a borrowed two-span interface.

### Zero-round setup and cleanup

Times are WF microseconds per allocate/fill/drain/free trace. Ratios span all
three counts. Cleanup visits every payload word through the checksum callback.

| Mode | Payload bytes | n=16, us/trace | n=256, us/trace | n=4096, us/trace | WF / loop C |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| normal | 8 | 0.047–0.048 | 0.539–0.562 | 8.500–8.875 | 1.702–2.000 |
| retained | 8 | 0.067 | 1.211–1.219 | 19.625 | 0.958–1.000 |
| normal | 256 | 0.545–0.549 | 8.656–8.914 | 141.375–148.000 | 0.961–1.006 |
| retained | 256 | 0.686–0.693 | 10.805–10.953 | 175.625–181.375 | 0.957–0.992 |

### Optimized transfers and scalar loop evidence

| Retained record path | WF copies per element | Loop C copies per element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pop front or back | 1 x 256-byte memcpy | 1 x 256-byte memcpy |
| Push front or back | 1 x 256-byte memmove | 1 x 256-byte memcpy |
| Rebase transfer loop | 1 x 256-byte memcpy | 1 x 256-byte memcpy |
| Drain to consumer | 1 x 256-byte memcpy | 1 x 256-byte memcpy |

The WF retained functions are `wf_deque_pop_front$instance$50`,
`wf_deque_push_back$instance$51`, `wf_deque_rebase$instance$52`,
`wf_deque_drain$instance$53`, `wf_deque_pop_back$instance$55`, and
`wf_deque_push_front$instance$56`. Neither retained trace adds another record
bulk copy at the endpoint boundary. Bulk C uses at most two dynamic extent
copies during rebase. WF memory operands often have alignment 1 where native
C has alignment 8; the generated ordinary WF ABI and C's internal fastcc
helpers also differ. Equal copy counts therefore do not imply equal lowering.

The scalar forward gap persists after the instrumentation correction and
reversed-order repeat. In normal optimized WF IR,
`wf_deque_library_trace$instance$37` block `bb32` has four i64 loads (head,
capacity, payload, length) and four stores (decremented length, advanced head,
payload, restored length) per hot-loop iteration. In optimized C,
`word_loop_library_trace` block `272` keeps header state in SSA, performs one
payload load and one payload store, and commits the header after the inner
loop. Both hot loops are scalar; SIMD vectorization is not their difference.
C's initial fill does vectorize, while WF retains per-element descriptor
traffic there too. Correct allocator information permits more source-header
hoisting in rebase, but destination-header traffic remains in WF's loop.

This is a concrete lowering improvement opportunity, not an attribution of
every nanosecond to four stores. Normal versus retained changes call visibility,
inlining and native conventions as well as transfers; it is not a pure
copy-cost experiment. The ordinary reference-taking interface can stay while
that issue is tested, and the measured baseline must remain available for the
same-source comparison.

A subsequent controlled IR probe isolated the relevant optimization fact for
this scalar specialization. Starting from the corrected normal LLVM, it either
added only `nuw` to the four dynamic u64 Ring payload GEPs, or split those same
GEPs into a header projection and payload indexing without adding any facts.
After Apple Clang 21 O2:

| IR variant | Scalar forward hot-loop loads / stores | Independent correctness executions |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Baseline | 4 / 4 | 1,296 passed |
| Unsigned non-wrapping GEP fact only | 1 payload load / 1 payload store; header state in SSA | 1,296 passed |
| Split GEP without new fact | 4 / 4 | 1,296 passed |

The fact-only variant also permits initial-fill vectorization. It identifies
an omitted fact sufficient to eliminate this specialization's metadata traffic;
it supplies no measured timing recovery percentage. Construction and all three
oracle checks took 2.26 seconds under the shared guard. Production lowering is unchanged. A
general improvement still needs qualification over all admitted storage/index
domains, including zero-sized elements, a compatible path for older LLVM,
and the same-source timing matrix. The bounded positive-stride u64 probe does
not establish that those other cases may receive the flag.

The maintained optional reproduction is
`make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library probe-scalar-gep`,
under the shared guard. It refuses drift from the exact four selected u64
GEPs, saves the optimized IR variants and their oracle results under
`.build/`, and requires a local Clang that accepts GEP `nuw`. It is outside
both daily checks and the ordinary benchmark targets. It changes no compiler
emission. The target was added after baseline timing: the measured Makefile
hash below predates it; the original three-variant target's Makefile was
`1facd9eafce1baabac65e456df6ba962b46abd45a944af4eeeaf5f0afbd4e020`.

#### Nonnegative-index assumption candidate

The next bounded probe adds a fourth variant to the same target. Immediately
before each of the same four positive-stride u64 payload GEPs, it inserts
`icmp sge i64 <actual normalized address index>, 0` and
`call void @llvm.assume(i1 <comparison>)`, leaving the original `inbounds`
GEP intact. One intrinsic declaration is added. The target requires exactly
four replacements and refuses an input already containing `llvm.assume` or
the probe's temporary-name suffix. This is a transformation of a fixed
baseline module, not a general lowering implementation.

The 2026-09-22 run used the unchanged Deque library, workload and C driver
identified in this report, and the v0.65 baseline compiler corresponding to merged
`1b916975`, SHA-256
`0ab0f5730590828c511d0a0d4d90d3131654377ea020e5634f5a0800ff9edb96`.
Its raw WF output is
`a32c7d14640f6f855f67149281fa839c65d3d30597c96bc50d8de8e012fa32b6`.
The extended Makefile is
`c5d94d9e71160a37894d11f3deca02b2ec659b8a017a1543646a3d739b9c77bc`.
Reproduction pins that baseline compiler rather than a future compiler that
may already emit the assumption:

```sh
BASELINE_WHITEFOOTC=/path/to/baseline/whitefootc
perl .github/run-check.pl ring-gep-portable-probe \
  make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library \
  probe-scalar-gep \
  WHITEFOOTC="$BASELINE_WHITEFOOTC" \
  CLANG=/usr/bin/clang
```

Set the variable to a saved compiler with the recorded baseline identity. Apple
Clang 21.0.0 (`clang-2100.3.34.2`) on the recorded arm64 host optimized,
linked and executed all four variants. Each passed 432 configurations and
1,296 independent checksum/allocation-ledger executions, for 5,184 executions
in total. No timing samples were collected. Probe construction and correctness
took 4.07 seconds, including rebuilt runtime objects; the complete shared
guard interval took 4.56 seconds including assembly generation. Assembly was
generated directly from each transformed input with
`clang -O2 -Wno-override-module -S -x ir`, matching the native executable's
input rather than reoptimizing the already optimized module.

Here `trace` means `wf_deque_library_trace$instance$37`, and the hot loop is
its forward-churn `bb32`. Branch counts are static instruction counts, not
dynamic branch frequencies. The full trace includes fill, reverse churn,
rebase and cleanup as well as that hot loop.

| Variant | Hot-loop i64 loads / stores | Optimized IR assume calls, trace / hot loop | AArch64 trace calls / conditional branches | AArch64 hot-loop calls / branches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 4 / 4 | 0 / 0 | 6 / 24 | 0 / 1 |
| GEP `nuw` | 1 / 1 | 0 / 0 | 6 / 30 | 0 / 1 |
| Split only | 4 / 4 | 0 / 0 | 6 / 24 | 0 / 1 |
| Nonnegative-index `assume` | 1 / 1 | 22 / 1 | 6 / 30 | 0 / 1 |

The assumption variant retains 34 intrinsic calls across the optimized
module, but none becomes an assembly call or a branch checking the sign.
The two fact-bearing variants have identical forward hot-loop instructions:
one payload load, one payload store, no call, and one loop backedge branch.
Both also allow initial-fill vectorization; their scalar trace has eight
`<2 x i64>` store instructions, versus none in the baseline or split control.
Their additional trace branches come with the same vectorized/loop forms,
not an extra assumption check. The complete scalar functions are nevertheless
different: the `nuw` variant has 310 machine instructions and the assumption
variant 305, with other-path register allocation and scheduling differences.
This is not a whole-function equivalence or performance claim. The record
trace's complete assembly is equal after removing comments and blank lines
(481 instructions), since this bounded probe does not change record payload
addresses.

| Variant | Optimized LLVM SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | `912fa2d161292a9d600f423d582ccbb3a20ba18606096b3dc55ebc86caa856c9` |
| GEP `nuw` | `a59d9fec4de6587daff422e9aca58590bb98b40fdde1c2137eae8a205e256116` |
| Split only | `2a8736557f16554218531368eb22d429a95225045bbf044fb3a9ca64070e2f7d` |
| Nonnegative-index `assume` | `a06f39c34ed65e80cd1c6fd1eaeea72668da4020771a588ad5ea85b4b817fb13` |

This evidence selects the normalized-index assumption as the production
candidate to evaluate: it communicates the useful local fact without
requiring newer GEP-flag syntax or making emitted syntax depend on a
build-time compiler that may differ from the actual IR consumer. It does not
establish that the two candidates have equal full-matrix cost. The target's
four-case `nuw` comparison still needs a recent LLVM; this run does not test
LLVM 18 or Apple Clang 15 compatibility of production output. The paired
production comparison below follows this probe; actual older-consumer
qualification remains a separate obligation. General padded-header/extent/index
qualification needs its own proof; this four-site experiment does not
establish it. These selected u64 sites do not qualify every alignment,
zero-stride step or maximum admitted index, and the preserved historical
CSV files are not measurements of this candidate.

#### Paired production lowering matrix, 2026-09-22

The production candidate in `302845b8` emits the nonnegative-index assumption
after ordinary target qualification. It is compared with the saved v0.65
compiler above, using the same library, workload, C source, seeds, allocator
observer and unchanged `check`/`measure` targets. The baseline compiler source
tree at `1b916975` is identical to `4e0903e9`, which produced that saved
compiler. The candidate compiler SHA-256 is
`9ad894ff6733c5e3efb489e98544bfcc61a5716dee5b976ac68d02713991a182`.
No source rule, container interface or payload representation changes in
this comparison. Its selection criterion was recorded before timing in
[X1's address investigation](../../../investigations/containers-and-resources/X1-LIBRARY.md#ring-payload-address-qualification).

Four independent build directories ran in the order baseline-A, candidate-A,
candidate-B, baseline-B. All construction preceded those four executions.
Within each execution the existing driver still reverses normal/retained
order, reverses C/WF cohort order, and rotates the first implementation over
eleven samples. All 10,368 correctness executions passed, including checksum,
exact request/byte/peak ledgers and zero live bytes. All 25,344 timing rows
have matching independent checksums and exact ledgers. Timed allocations
succeed; these rows do not inject allocation refusal or replace the formal
tests of the language's resource-abort outcome.

The compressed [paired samples](measurements-ring-addressing.csv.gz) add
`experiment,build,sweep,order` to the unchanged fifteen-column CSV.
`experiment=production` contains the 25,344 main-matrix rows; removing those
four columns reconstructs each original CSV byte-for-byte. Each main file
contains 576 groups of eleven samples. The later placement discriminator
adds 6,336 rows with `experiment=placement`, described below; these are not
pooled into the main table. For each matched run/cohort/mode/payload/path/
capacity, first take the eleven-sample median; then compute candidate/baseline.
The normalized ratio is `(candidate WF / candidate loop-C) /
(baseline WF / baseline loop-C)`. Each table row summarizes 24 such ratios
(two sweeps, two runs, two cohorts, three capacities), without weighting by
an assumed application mix. Entries are median [minimum, maximum]. Values
below one favor the candidate. The final column is the median candidate
WF/loop-C cost, not a transfer-only or whole-language parity measure.

| Mode | Payload bytes | Path | Candidate/baseline | Normalized candidate/baseline | Candidate/loop-C |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Normal | 8 | Forward churn | 0.526 [0.495, 0.562] | 0.533 [0.515, 0.552] | 1.233 |

The main scalar forward result repeats at both larger capacities in both
version orders. At 256 elements, baseline WF/loop-C is 2.302–2.349 and the
candidate is 1.209–1.238; at 4096, these are 2.280–2.304 and 1.204–1.261.
Scalar `wf_deque_library_trace$instance$37`'s optimized forward loop `bb32`
changes from four i64 loads and four stores to one payload load and one
payload store. Its header values remain in SSA until the loop exits. The
remaining approximately 20–26% gap against C is not attributed by this
comparison. Retained forward results near one show that this is primarily
an inlined-path optimization, not a necessary reference-call transfer cost.

There is also a repeatable adverse result: retained scalar reverse churn
is slower in every matched group. Its normalized median is 1.072 in sweep A
and 1.071 in the reversed sweep B. Per-capacity normalized ranges are
1.072–1.088 at 16, 1.053–1.086 at 256, and 1.048–1.070 at 4096.
Disassembly of the measured retained executables finds identical instruction
sequences in scalar `pop_back$46` (12 instructions), `push_front$47`
(15 instructions), and `trace$37` (130 instructions, with local branch
targets compared relative to its entry), as well as the scalar make/accept
helpers. The trace entry is unchanged, but the two endpoint entries move
from `0x100002c54`/`0x100002c84` to `0x100002c34`/`0x100002c64`.
Code placement is therefore a concrete confounder; it has not yet been
isolated as the cause. There is no added instruction or data dependency in
those retained scalar bodies that establishes an intrinsic assumption cost.
This unresolved loss prevents claiming that the predeclared selection
criterion is fully met. It must not be averaged away by the forward gain.

A scratch layout discriminator added only `align 128` to scalar
`pop_back$46` in each retained input, preserving every other input byte.
The two resulting images place `pop_back`/`push_front` at the same addresses,
`0x100002d00`/`0x100002d30`, with the same instructions. However, both also
move the trace and make/accept callbacks by 96 bytes relative to their
respective originals. The trace becomes `0x10000266c`; the callbacks become
`0x100002400`/`0x100002404`. All five functions still have identical
instruction sequences across all four images. This fails the predeclared
control that the original caller position remain unchanged. Construction
took 0.193/0.187 seconds; the guarded audit stopped after 0.53 seconds with
exit 255, before any oracle or timing execution. It produced no timing CSV
and neither establishes nor refutes the placement explanation. The local
`.build/ring-align128-clang21/isolation.txt` audit has SHA-256
`14f1669e875e8de6e9d5993ca5cc62fb2eebe7c214cf1a07ff76141bd64d44f3`.
This experimental alignment is not a production policy.

A final scratch discriminator inserted eight unexecuted AArch64 `nop`
instructions immediately before the candidate's scalar `pop_back` symbol,
after the preceding function's `ret`, without raising section alignment.
Assembly-and-link controls with no padding first matched all 269 function
symbols' addresses and instructions against the original executables. With
the 32-byte gap, the five relevant candidate bodies match the original
baseline's addresses and instructions: both endpoints return to
`0x100002c54`/`0x100002c84`, and the trace and callbacks retain their original
positions. This instrument passed its isolation control and both 1,296-case
native oracles before measurement.

The unchanged retained driver then ran baseline-control A, candidate-pad32 A,
candidate-pad32 B, baseline-control B, collecting 1,584 rows per invocation.
The same eleven-sample medians and loop-C normalization give these scalar
reverse-churn ratios; ranges cover the two cohorts in each sweep:

| Capacity | Sweep A raw | Sweep A normalized | Sweep B raw | Sweep B normalized |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 1.072–1.072 | 1.072–1.072 | 1.000–1.000 | 1.000–1.000 |
| 256 | 1.079–1.079 | 1.079–1.079 | 1.007–1.007 | 1.007–1.007 |
| 4096 | 1.057–1.063 | 1.056–1.057 | 1.000–1.000 | 0.994–1.000 |

The loss therefore does **not** collapse in both orders. Loop-C drift is
only 1.000–1.006; the final baseline-control itself becomes slower relative
to C, while the padded candidate remains around 1.088 times C. Across the
twelve pairs the normalized median is 1.031 [0.994, 1.079], but that pooled
number hides the order difference. This does not isolate the original loss
as an endpoint-placement cost. It leaves the approximately seven-percent
production result unexplained; no further instrument was selected here.
The eight inserted instructions are an experiment, not production lowering.

Construction took 0.783 seconds, the two oracles 0.871 seconds, and four
measurement invocations 6.159 seconds; the complete guard took 7.96 seconds
and exited zero. All 6,336 added rows pass the same ledger/checksum/group
checks. They use synthetic `run=0` because the direct driver's fourteen-column
CSV has no outer Makefile run. Removing the four metadata columns and that
synthetic run reconstructs the four driver files exactly. Their identities,
in execution order, are:

| Placement CSV | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline A | `258289076c757d1157ee2e6b39d4c7f0e14cf3228c77bb090d43c00a7815e7dd` |
| Candidate A | `65e46fb51712c2914e39c0ca2ce4d435f54a2eb57d1272419b44c5f8af5a305c` |
| Candidate B | `61a176e0fbfe938626e2b13d74e38488e8364e51ace8c7b3113cc69260d5fceb` |
| Baseline B | `6815e72005ab437791e166821b5b79070637c3432beba4aee199c76524d1c264` |

The other production-matrix cells do not show a similarly material slowdown
in every matched group. Retained wide setup at capacity 256 has a 1.006–1.016 normalized
ratio, but raw ratios straddle one. All elapsed samples are quantized to
1,000 ns. Small changes near one percent, and wide traces dominated by the
32-word checksum, do not establish a precise gain or parity. Setup figures
include materialization and cleanup; they are not subtracted to manufacture
isolated endpoint latency. Normal/retained differences include inlining,
visibility and ABI effects, rather than isolating copies alone.

For this workload, deleting only the candidate's one `llvm.assume`
declaration, eight `%*.nonnegative = icmp sge i64 ..., 0` instructions and
eight corresponding intrinsic calls makes its **raw** LLVM byte-identical
to the baseline. That comparison does not normalize optimized instructions.
The zero-capacity layout repair does not alter this positive-capacity
workload's emission. A/B native binaries are byte-identical for each version
and mode; their optimized WF files differ only in the `ModuleID` path.
Both C optimized controls are byte-identical in all four builds. Raw hashes:

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline raw WF | `a32c7d14640f6f855f67149281fa839c65d3d30597c96bc50d8de8e012fa32b6` |

Reproduction uses the existing targets, not a second harness. Set
`BASELINE_WHITEFOOTC` and `CANDIDATE_WHITEFOOTC` to the binaries with the
identities above. Under one repository guard, construct the four independent
`BUILD=.build/ring-<version>-<sweep>-clang21` directories using each version's
compiler and `CLANG=/usr/bin/clang`, requesting these six existing targets:

```sh
make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library \
  WHITEFOOTC="$WHITEFOOTC" CLANG=/usr/bin/clang BUILD="$BUILD" \
  "$BUILD/deque-costs-normal" "$BUILD/deque-costs-retained" \
  "$BUILD/deque-library-normal.opt.ll" "$BUILD/deque-library-retained.opt.ll" \
  "$BUILD/control-normal.opt.ll" "$BUILD/control-retained.opt.ll"
```

After all four constructions, invoke the unchanged `measure` target in
baseline-A, candidate-A, candidate-B, baseline-B order, with the same compiler
and build arguments. Retain each `BUILD/measurements.csv` and its identity.
Use `perl .github/run-check.pl <label> /bin/sh -c '<commands>'` around the
whole sequence. This read-only check verifies the packed sample groups,
allocation formulas and cross-implementation checksum agreement; the native
`check` target remains the independent logical-order and live-allocation oracle:

The observed costs below separate construction from the
correctness phase and the following timed-driver phase; the latter two
include their Make/driver overhead.

| Version/order | Construction seconds | Correctness seconds | Timing phase seconds |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Baseline-A | 1.64 | 0.711 | 5.687 |
| Candidate-A | 1.90 | 0.652 | 5.658 |
| Candidate-B | 1.63 | 0.492 | 5.662 |
| Baseline-B | 1.62 | 0.527 | 5.683 |

The complete guarded invocation took 33.55 seconds and exited 2 **after**
the four successful Clang 21 matrices: its subsequent LLVM 22 native
baseline construction failed in `deque-costs-normal` code generation with
`fatal error: error in backend: Unsupported stack probing method` and
`clang frontend command failed with exit code 70`. The generated baseline
LLVM retains `"probe-stack"="__chkstk_darwin"`; it was not removed to obtain
a result. No LLVM 22 native correctness or timing result is claimed.

A separate 0.96-second guarded invocation used LLVM 22.1.8, commit
`ca7933e47d3a3451d81e72ac174dcb5aa28b59d1`, to build only the existing four
optimized-IR targets for baseline and candidate. All eight unmodified WF/C
modules parsed and optimized. Its scalar forward loop likewise changes
from four loads/stores to one each. This qualifies parsing and optimization
only; Apple Clang 21 is the sole native/timing toolchain of this matrix.
Neither result claims local Apple Clang 15 availability or LLVM 18 native
qualification. The historical `measurements.csv` and
`measurements-v0.64.csv` remain unchanged.

### Instrumentation correction

The first adapter renamed `malloc` to an accounting wrapper while leaving
WF's declaration as `declare ptr @wf_cost_allocate(i64)`. Clang inferred
`noalias nonnull` from the C wrapper's body but the separately optimized WF
module lost the allocator information associated with the `malloc` name.
Its rebase then had to consider aliasing between the old and fresh backings.
The provisional timing gap cannot be called an ordinary compiler cost.
The adapter now preserves the wrapper's true fresh, nonnull return contract
with `declare noalias nonnull ptr @wf_cost_allocate(i64)`: the wrapper adds
a private header to a new allocation and exits on failure. No argument alias
attribute or memory-effect promise is added. Independent checksum and exact
allocation formulas are rerun before accepting corrected measurements.

### Reproduction and units

The host is Apple M1 Pro, eight logical CPUs, arm64 macOS 26.6.2 / Darwin
25.6.0, with Apple Clang 21.0.0 (`clang-2100.3.34.2`). The guarded local command
is `make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library measure`.
Normal mode permits O2 inlining. Retained mode marks the library, workload,
make and consume helpers noinline; primitive operations inside rebase/drain
remain ordinary optimized element operations. C endpoint helpers take the
address of the pointer owner, just as WF takes `&Box<Ring<T>>`, and return the
new length where WF does. Both retain the final `free_empty` boundary. C keeps
one external trace wrapper in normal mode and the additional generic trace
boundary in retained mode, matching the WF translation-unit boundary.

Two complete runs reverse normal/retained executable order. Each includes
two cohorts with reversed implementation order and eleven samples rotating
the first implementation. The CSV's `run`, `cohort`, and `traces` fields
preserve those distinctions. Nonzero-round figures divide elapsed time by
`rounds * count` and describe amortized complete churn/rebase traces per
element, including setup and final cleanup. Setup figures divide by `traces`
and describe one complete zero-round trace. Ratios use medians within a
run/cohort. Every word of a wide record enters the checksum, whose cost is
included; close record ratios are not a universal native-parity result.

Incremental experiment construction took 0.55 seconds (WF emission, native
compilation/linking and optimized IR), then `make measure` including its
correctness checks took 6.63 seconds. This excludes a Rust compiler build and
a cold runtime-object build. `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` samples on this host have
microsecond granularity; normalized decimal places are not clock precision.
Ratios around one percent from equality are not a precise gain or parity
claim: quantization, cohort variation and the checksum's substantial share of
record work limit that inference.

The measured compiler SHA-256 was
`4311534e72d2df6ccb2f6043465a801f42f98a70f940f1249755267da2b8c31e`.
The subsequent const-forwarding repair's compiler
`5d3a09f7f07b09ac333615830340878a24daa81ef42d5e61c3a5200098aa84c5`
emitted byte-identical raw LLVM for this source. No specification change is
part of this experiment. Artifact SHA-256 values fix the corrected baseline:

### Integration verification at dcbfdc0f

After merging main `7127bcb6`, the freshly built compiler at `dcbfdc0f` had
SHA-256 `9653362a116997dd34558b9da6436dfb343018631b4fabcaa255e420a0c80005`.
The library, workload and C driver retain their baseline source hashes above.
The raw WF output and both normal/retained optimized modules are byte-identical
to the preserved baseline, as are both C controls' optimized IR. Each old/current
optimized WF module was also compiled with Apple Clang 21.0.0 on the same
arm64 host using `clang -O2 -Wno-override-module -S -x ir`; the complete
assembly files compare byte-for-byte equal, without normalization.

| Current artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Normal optimized LLVM | `fa94c2c058791b408fdff75be414408bd830f54e4bfa532e12ad21325ca61cb0` |
| Retained optimized LLVM | `9a314178b5abc2f1b631f65427bd7ce16b985bfc11b5521138c2ac60391349fd` |
| Normal old/current assembly | `6ffaa7605a55f50d54cf89308f9f12e92cd31e1d1835e8cc7fc3afcb03c3ec4d` |

This is emitted-module evidence from optimized IR, not a byte-identity claim
for the complete linked native image. The runtime's C, header and LLVM
sources and `compiler/runtime.mk` were unchanged. Current normal/retained
harnesses passed all 2,592 correctness executions again. Incremental
construction took 0.80 seconds and the executions plus retained-call checks
took 0.73 seconds. No new timings were collected: the original CSV remains
the dated baseline, with no claim of a fresh measurement, a different
toolchain's output, or untested instantiations.

The maintained `probe-scalar-gep` target was executed once in the same guarded
interval, taking 2.13 seconds for construction and checks. Its baseline,
fact-only and split-only variants each passed 1,296 oracle executions; reading
the current scalar `bb32` reproduces 4/4, 1/1 and 4/4 i64 loads/stores. The
target saves `deque-gep-{baseline,nuw,split}.opt.ll` and corresponding
`.check.txt` files under `.build/`. Their optimized-IR hashes are:

| Probe variant | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | `50b2c6766470eea22411ad6664d9bc97cbb5835b1ff5bcbeb997f023df490a4a` |
| Unsigned fact only | `5b42af64e26d2717df662a72cb9346b0419b83f9fb50a63eb87802f047591e2c` |
| Split only | `db139c31763151222cbb33b39630699a548eded6192d1ad939c53db028e4a5e6` |

The complete Slab/Deque integration interval took 7.51 seconds. This confirms
the optional reproduction wiring and bounded code-generation observation;
it does not add the flag to production lowering or measure a speedup.

Requalification after main PR #80 used merge `4da1710e` (main `95b21cfd`)
and compiler SHA-256
`cb399df104e975c607973f151dd87a4caf2e4a0e9606a468b4ea69d683345a48`.
The library, workload, C driver, Makefile, runtime inputs and CSV were
unchanged. Fresh raw, normal-optimized and retained-optimized WF LLVM were
byte-identical to the saved `dcbfdc0f` artifacts; both C-control optimized
modules retained their exact hashes. The recorded raw/optimized identities
therefore also identify this fresh emission, without normalization.

The guarded `slab-deque-pr80-emission` command requested these Make targets:

```sh
make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library \
  .build/deque-library-normal.opt.ll .build/deque-library-retained.opt.ll \
  .build/control-normal.opt.ll .build/control-retained.opt.ll
```

Deque emission/optimization took 0.28 seconds; the combined Slab/Deque guard
interval took 1.03 seconds. The C targets were already current. The earlier
native checks, assembly comparison and optional-probe evidence are reused
because their inputs are unchanged. No native relink, execution, probe or
timing was repeated. The original CSV remains historical timing evidence,
with no fresh performance or wider toolchain claim.

#### v0.64 predecessor-lowering comparison

Main PR #88, merged as `ce9a3870` from `e8e1c411`, releases v0.64 and changes
`place_front`'s predecessor calculation to `(head == 0 ? capacity : head) - 1`.
This avoids an overflowing intermediate for large header-only capacities,
but also changes positive-stride scalar and record endpoint code. Unlike the
earlier integrations, this requires a fresh timing comparison. The library,
workload, C driver and controls have not changed. The old
[`measurements.csv`](measurements.csv) remains the pre-v0.64 baseline.

The gate compiler SHA-256 is
`b68db16443f0606ef5d3217014fbdb1bdae0ea01bc23452eff27e2626bbc24ff`;
the active specification is
`bc4d465d698a63518d4c768bfa0b4147afa15e328e32f8adac3f27980c7a21ed`.
The current Makefile is
`1facd9eafce1baabac65e456df6ba962b46abd45a944af4eeeaf5f0afbd4e020`:
its difference from the original measured Makefile is the optional probe,
not the check or measurement matrix.

Comparison with the saved `dcbfdc0f` optimized modules isolates retained
changes to `wf_deque_push_front$instance$47` (scalar),
`wf_deque_push_front$instance$56` (record), and their primitive bodies
`wf_place_front$instance$63` and `$68`. Their predecessor arithmetic and
address scheduling differ in generated assembly; normal mode contains the
corresponding inlined reverse-churn change. The retained record-copy counts
above are unchanged. The new raw module also contains the POSIX resource
writer's EINTR retry helper, which is removed by optimization under the
accounting allocator's nonnull contract; it is not a timed-path difference.
Both C-control optimized modules and the linked runtime's C/header/LLVM
sources and `compiler/runtime.mk` are unchanged. The assembly comparison
uses the same optimized-IR-to-arm64 command as above and concerns the emitted
WF module, not the complete linked image.

The current scalar forward hot block still has four i64 loads and four stores.
The maintained probe still structurally selects exactly four positive-stride
u64 Ring payload GEPs. The historical `dcbfdc0f` probe result is reused, not
rerun or relabelled as a v0.64 execution: the changed predecessor is in the
other endpoint path and does not supply the missing unsigned address fact.
No production GEP flag or container API change is part of this comparison.

Compiler construction with `make -C compiler build` took 46.94 seconds;
Deque emission/optimization took 0.28 seconds. The complete guarded
Slab/Deque build, emission and conditional assembly comparison took
48.38 seconds. These construction figures are separate from the native
check and timing run below.

The new [`measurements-v0.64.csv`](measurements-v0.64.csv), collected on
2026-09-22 on the same host/toolchain, contains all 6,336 samples from the
unchanged matrix. Its SHA-256 is
`e297a90a7ce0f56f116c9697aece4f10dcf0a4d6c855e97e0a7b1cb89db26638`.
Reproduce through the existing target, then preserve its output separately:

```sh
perl .github/run-check.pl deque-v64-measure \
  make -C research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library measure
cp research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/.build/measurements.csv \
  research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/measurements-v0.64.csv
```

Both modes again passed 2,592 correctness executions in total, and retained
IR still has 20 WF and 40 C helper call sites. Every timing row passed the
same checksum and allocation ledger checks. Incremental native construction
took 0.58 seconds. Observing the existing `make measure` output boundary
after its retained-call check separates 0.790 seconds for correctness from
5.740 seconds for the timing matrix, including each phase's Make/output
overhead; total check plus measurement was 6.529 seconds. The whole guarded
construction/check/measurement/copy interval took 7.14 seconds.

The following table uses the same units and per-run/cohort median method as
the original table. It is a new complete cohort, not a replacement of the
historical values or an isolated instruction-latency comparison.

| Mode | Payload bytes | Trace | WF ns/step, n=4096 | WF / loop C | WF / bulk C |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| normal | 8 | forward churn | 3.204 | 2.256–2.405 | 2.283–2.349 |
| normal | 8 | reverse churn | 3.601–3.754 | 1.196–1.230 | 1.194–1.240 |
| normal | 8 | wrapped rebase | 4.883–5.066 | 1.648–1.909 | 1.648–2.683 |
| retained | 8 | forward churn | 4.791–5.127 | 0.994–1.035 | 1.000–1.028 |
| retained | 8 | reverse churn | 5.157–5.554 | 1.032–1.158 | 1.013–1.158 |
| retained | 8 | wrapped rebase | 8.240–8.392 | 1.028–1.098 | 1.089–1.201 |
| normal | 256 | forward churn | 34.363–34.637 | 0.978–1.026 | 0.987–1.014 |
| normal | 256 | reverse churn | 34.424–34.821 | 0.986–1.008 | 0.977–1.006 |
| normal | 256 | wrapped rebase | 46.997–48.676 | 0.976–1.025 | 0.993–1.108 |
| retained | 256 | forward churn | 38.086–39.795 | 0.948–0.991 | 0.952–0.992 |
| retained | 256 | reverse churn | 37.994–38.422 | 0.932–0.973 | 0.937–0.979 |
| retained | 256 | wrapped rebase | 57.159–58.472 | 0.919–0.989 | 0.977–1.041 |

The zero-round setup/cleanup cohort is preserved too; times are microseconds
per complete trace, with no subtraction from the operation traces:

| Mode | Payload bytes | n=16, us/trace | n=256, us/trace | n=4096, us/trace | WF / loop C |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| normal | 8 | 0.047–0.048 | 0.539 | 8.500 | 1.690–1.971 |
| retained | 8 | 0.067–0.069 | 1.211–1.273 | 19.625–21.250 | 0.959–1.024 |
| normal | 256 | 0.546–0.565 | 8.625–8.695 | 142.250–143.875 | 0.942–0.996 |
| retained | 256 | 0.689–0.711 | 10.852–10.906 | 175.875–181.500 | 0.948–0.970 |

The changed reverse path still has a scalar normal-mode gap (1.196–1.230
against loop C, previously 1.175–1.220), while record traces remain
competitive in this matrix. The unchanged scalar forward code still costs
2.256–2.405 times loop C. These ranges do not isolate a causal percentage
for the predecessor rewrite: the old and new cohorts ran at different times,
retained scalar reverse results vary more in the new cohort, and the samples
still have one-microsecond granularity. The evidence supports retaining the
same lowering-improvement questions, not asserting a speedup, regression
threshold or general native parity from small ratio differences.

Requalification after main PR #87 used merge `fd41dcc8` (main `8d6da723`),
which releases v0.65, and compiler SHA-256
`0ab0f5730590828c511d0a0d4d90d3131654377ea020e5634f5a0800ff9edb96`.
Fresh normal and retained optimized WF modules compare byte-for-byte equal
to the saved v0.64 artifacts in the table above, without normalization;
both C-control modules are unchanged too. Library, workload, harness,
native runtime inputs and both CSVs retain their identities. Gate-profile
compiler construction took 46.75 seconds; Deque emission/optimization
through the same four Make targets took 0.27 seconds, and the shared
`slab-deque-v65-emission` interval took 1.14 seconds. This confirms emitted
WF module correspondence on the recorded Apple Clang 21 / arm64
configuration. No native relink, execution, probe or timing was repeated;
the v0.64 CSV remains the dated measured cohort, not a fresh v0.65 result.

### Next scalar reverse-churn discriminator: precise endpoint effects

The current optimized scalar reverse loop reloads `cap` and `head` around the
`pop_back`/`push_front` pair even though the endpoint contracts leave capacity
unchanged. The next source-only diagnostic narrows `deque_push_front` from
`writes(values.inner)` to the fields it actually changes: `head`, `next` and
`len`. Its algorithm, ownership transfer, public arguments, and checksums stay
unchanged; `deque_pop_back` is untouched. The hypothesis is that the narrower
row lets the emitter or LLVM retain the invariant capacity across the pair.

Before timing, the rebuilt candidate must pass the full Deque correctness and
allocation images. The optimized scalar reverse loop must show at least one
fewer capacity load per inner iteration, with no new call, spill, frame growth,
or extra payload transfer; forward, wide, rebase and cleanup bodies must be
unchanged except for symbol/hash renaming. A code or ledger mismatch stops
without timing. If the code criterion passes, run the complete ecosystem
matrix with the existing 1 ms/10% stability qualification; any useful-cell
regression rejects the row change. This experiment measures whether effect-row
precision exposes an existing invariant; it does not amend the specification
or promise a new operation.

The source candidate was rejected before IR generation. With the exact row

```text
fn deque_push_front<T>(values: &Box<Ring<T>>, value: T) -> length: u64
  writes(values.inner.head), writes(values.inner.next), writes(values.inner.len)
```

the compiler reports `EFF-2 EffectMismatch`: the body calls the prelude
`place_front`, whose declared row is `writes(window)`, so the required covering
row is `writes(values.inner)`. The rejection is the current effect-row
boundary, not a performance observation. The candidate source was restored;
no Deque timing or production API change resulted. A follow-up would have to
re-evaluate the prelude operation's own row and its specification grounds
before any code-generation comparison.

### Follow-up discriminator: prelude `place_front` row precision

The rejected source row points at the prelude boundary. A scratch-only follow-up
will change the ordinary prelude declaration of `place_front` to
`writes(window.head), writes(window.next), writes(window.len)` and add no new
operation or syntax; the Deque wrapper will use the same three-field row. The
candidate is admissible only if the prelude contract still covers the endpoint
semantics and all existing users compile. Before timing, the scalar reverse
inner loop must lose at least one repeated `cap` load, while the forward, wide,
rebase and cleanup bodies remain unchanged apart from identity renaming. The
complete Deque correctness, allocation, checksum and cleanup checks must pass.
Any acceptance failure, unchanged optimized shape, extra transfer, or useful
cell regression rejects the diagnostic. This is an investigation of a possible
effect-row correction; it does not select a specification amendment or change
the production branch.

The follow-up was rejected before IR generation. The prelude declaration is
generic over `W`, so the requested field paths are not admitted by the prefix
type:

```text
<prelude>/place_front.wf:1:67: compiler failure in Semantics: InvalidEffectRow
  source: fn place_front<W, T>(window: &W, value: T) -> result: unit writes(window.head), writes(window.next), writes(window.len) contract {
  marker:                                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^
  reason: each effect-path suffix must select a field, payload, measure, window part, or indexed position admitted by its prefix type
  mechanical_fix: select a member or position admitted by the prefix type, or name the reference parameter's complete state; use .inner for Box contents
```

This is a generic effect-row typing restriction, not a timing result. The
scratch prelude, wrapper and module changes were restored; no candidate binary,
matrix or production change was retained.

### Scratch compound back-to-front replacement

The original description called reverse churn a rotation of the same owner
and proposed unchanged ordinary take/place source. The retained patch does
neither. The original trace takes the back value, consumes it, constructs a
new value from the next seed, and places the new value at the front. The
scratch fixture constructs first, calls a new `replace_back_front` prelude
row, then consumes the removed value. Its operation is
`RunReplaceBackFront`, not `RunRotateBackFront`.

The compound body captures the old back payload before writing the new front
slot and updates head while leaving length unchanged. This covers the
full-capacity same-slot case but changes the intermediate ring state and
construction/consumption order. The measured scalar and inline-record
bindings perform bounded local arithmetic, with no per-element allocation,
nested-owner release or external effects; the consumers receive the same
values in the same order. Their logical sequence, digest and instrumented
allocation ledger are preserved. That evidence does not establish equivalence
for arbitrary `DequeElement` implementations: a boxed payload can change from
release-before-allocation to allocation-before-release. A `pure` constructor
does not exclude allocation under STOR-8.

The recorded code criterion required removal of duplicate descriptor loads
and boundary arithmetic without additional calls, spills, frame growth or
payload transfers, and preservation of the other workload bodies apart from
symbol identity. The scratch package passed those code and concrete-fixture
oracle screens. The baseline optimized reverse block loads old
length/head/capacity around two endpoint operations; the candidate loads
length and capacity once, captures the back slot, writes the replacement
front slot and stores only the new head. Both images passed 576 configurations
and 2,592 executions, including checksum/cleanup faults; the 120 instrumented
accounting rows match. These observations do not test callback commutation or
nested-owner lifetimes for a general source transformation.

The matched O3 matrix used the same work (`1048576`), seeds, seven samples,
two cohorts and native controls. Baseline qualified as 14 pass, 5 deficit and
5 inconclusive cells; the candidate qualified as 17 pass, 2 deficit and 5
inconclusive. The three scalar 8-byte reverse-churn cells moved from
`1.412/1.406`, `1.409/1.409` and `1.387/1.389` times C++ to
`0.513/0.510`, `0.512/0.510` and `0.508/0.507` (cohorts 0/1). Scalar growth
deficits remain; one wide reverse cell became inconclusive from sample overlap,
not a measured slowdown. Baseline and candidate samples are retained in
`ecosystem-replace-back-front-baseline-samples.csv` and
`ecosystem-replace-back-front-candidate-samples.csv` (SHA-256
`b731c9660942d0dc1e252840a191c709641751e9983d440871e47eb79c5965b2` and
`7713699d175a3ca4b041e247e1df617f5eefae9d1e98818512aeb50394d20`), with the
scratch source/compiler patch in `deque-replace-back-front.patch`.

These timings describe the rewritten concrete fixture with a temporary
compound prelude operation, not a source-equivalent production optimization.
The patch remains research evidence and was restored from the worktree. A
future ordinary operation or checked fusion proposal must state its ordering
contract and prove the applicable owner/callback domain; the existing samples
do not select either. The later ordinary front-slot reuse change below is
independent and preserves the source operation sequence.

### Production lowering: reuse a front-placement slot

The source-level `place_front` operation already computes the physical slot it
stores. Before commit `5ae2cdd40793e617dbbe88d3fc38681db983166f`, the emitter
called `boundary_slot` a second time while updating the Ring header. That
second call reloaded `head` and `cap`, repeated the zero-head select and
predecessor subtraction, and then stored the same slot as the new `head`.
The production lowering now carries the first slot through
`move_run_boundary`; the take and back-placement paths keep their old code.
This is a spec-neutral lowering change and does not add a source operation.

The backend regression
`front_placement_reuses_the_written_ring_slot_for_the_new_head` checks the
raw emitted `place_front` body: after the payload store only the length is
loaded, exactly two descriptor stores remain, and the head store uses the
payload GEP's physical index. The focused gate test passed. The unchanged
source/accounting images each passed 576 configurations and 2,592 executions,
including checksum and cleanup fault controls; their 120 accounting rows are byte
for byte identical. The retained source checks still passed 432
configurations and 1,296 executions per image.

The matched practical A/B used the same compiler revision except for this
commit, the same work (`1048576`), seeds, seven samples, two cohorts and native
controls. The fresh reducer classified baseline as 16 pass, 5 deficit and 3
inconclusive cells; the candidate as 18 pass, 2 deficit and 4 inconclusive.
The three scalar 8-byte reverse-churn cells moved from WF/C++
`1.411/1.411`, `1.405/1.399` and `1.386/1.384` (cohorts 0/1) to
`0.499/0.498`, `0.497/0.503` and `0.494/0.493`. Candidate/baseline paired
medians for those cells were `0.353`, `0.355` and `0.355`. Forward, growth,
wide and setup cells changed by at most about 2.1%, within the recorded
sample variation; the two scalar growth deficits at counts 256 and 4096
remain. The durable samples are
`ecosystem-boundary-reuse-baseline-samples.csv`
(`f488a5386dbdbc0b5bc5f928dbdaa7382084d44b32d4e783c2c520d44a20d784`) and
`ecosystem-boundary-reuse-candidate-samples.csv`
(`1786cf4bc907a01b20e805f34920a63a62e7d8e061d0664988bdea6378ed6f2e`);
both accounting files have SHA-256
`0ac88c02c5e9ca9517a584cdb75236a3ce1cc09497c4bd2f1e64ae9c835a2fcc`.

This closes the previously measured duplicate descriptor work in the
front-placement lowering. Rebase's per-element transfer and the remaining
scalar growth gap are separate questions and remain open.

### Prospective Ring back-placement entry-capacity fact

This criterion is recorded before implementing or measuring the candidate.
The question is whether stating one already-discharged PRE-1 precondition to
LLVM removes the destination-wrap work in scalar growth, including its
additional append loop. The candidate changes only optional fact emission;
the source program, operation rows, typed IR, library policy, allocation
schedule and per-element transfer remain unchanged. The completed comparison
below rejects this uniform candidate under the recorded regression rule.

The complete mapping starts at `place_back`'s `window^.len < window^.cap`
requirement in [PRE-1, OP-10, FN-8]. Actual-expression obligations and all
instantiated requirements succeed before ordinary call transfer. The private
checked program is the lowering authority [DIAG-2]. Its compiler-owned row
body becomes one typed `RunBoundary::PlaceBack`; the emitter verifies the
window-reference and element types and reads the entry descriptor before any
payload or header store. The length and capacity are u64 measures [MSR-1].
Therefore `icmp ult i64 entry_len, entry_cap` is true at that point. It is not
a fact about the post-placement length, the physical index, or head plus
length. No requirement is rechecked at runtime or rediscovered by another
acceptance path.

The source precondition applies to fixed/runtime Slots and Ring storage,
including zero-size and owning elements. The experiment emits it only for
Ring `PlaceBack`, where the existing address calculation already reads
capacity. Fixed capacity comes from the type constant; runtime capacity comes
from the existing descriptor accessor, including the owner-slot indirection
of runtime-content references. Capacity zero admits no reachable placement.
Capacities above `i64::MAX` remain valid for admitted zero-size storage, so the
comparison must be unsigned. Nonzero head remains unrestricted by this fact:
`cap=4, head=3, len=1` is a valid placement whose destination wraps. The fact
does not authorize `head + len < cap`, no-wrap arithmetic, or a signed bound
on logical coordinates. Ordinary target qualification remains unconditional
and precedes both facts-on and facts-off emission.

With a head value already known to LLVM to be zero, the existing back-slot
expression adds zero to entry length and tests that sum against capacity.
The new fact makes that comparison false and leaves a direct length index.
Fresh construction already stores head zero; no new head fact is supplied.
This deduction does not eliminate a rebase source's front update: its final
`head + 1` legitimately wraps. Nor does it establish SIMD by itself; inlining,
induction analysis, alias information and native optimizer decisions still
determine the additional append loop's code. Its scalar make callback is an
identity, so a retained wrap expression is a concrete discriminator rather
than evidence of a callback cost.

The structural assessment covers `compiler`, `language`,
`compiler/backend-facts`, `compiler/prelude-records`,
`compiler/storage-representation`, `compiler/storage-placement`, and the
Deque rebase decision. The existing optional window-address-fact emitter is
the appropriate owner: extend its test observations to both fact families,
the existing address family alone, and neither. Production retains one
emission choice. Keep the new assertion in Ring `PlaceBack` and share the
existing wrap arithmetic through a helper accepting its already-loaded
capacity; do not give arbitrary callers an unchecked proof flag. Name its
predicate from an existing fresh SSA operand so withholding it changes no
ordinary SSA numbering or instructions. This requires no new IR operation,
checker fact store, module or production switch. The pending
[backend-fact amendment](../../../../design/amendments/ring-placement-entry-capacity.md)
records the proposed narrowing of the current decision to withhold logical
coordinate assertions. It is the only new file, serves this fact experiment,
and is removed when ruled; this section remains the evidence owner. Bulk
transfer and broader fact propagation remain separate investigations because
their proof scope and generated work differ.

Before timing, require all of the following observations:

- The existing four-shape backend matrix keeps its normalized-address
  checks. Only Ring `PlaceBack` gains one unsigned entry-capacity predicate,
  before every payload/header store and using the existing entry operands.
  Removing that predicate and its assumption reproduces the address-only
  module; removing both families reproduces ordinary emission. Target
  qualification and ordinary arithmetic flags are identical in all three.
- Fixed/runtime programs independently check payload order and descriptor
  outcomes when placement ends exactly full and when nonzero head requires
  physical wrapping. Zero-size placements at capacities above the signed
  range check the unsigned domain. Execute ordinary and retained-call forms,
  preserving existing ownership and zero-capacity qualification controls.
  Fault observations replace the new assumption with a runtime observer
  before optimization: signed comparison, post-length and head-plus-length
  mutations must be detected. A false `llvm.assume` is undefined behavior,
  not a dependable fault oracle.
- On the unchanged Deque source, the final native scalar growth body loses
  destination-wrap comparison/select/subtraction work on the fresh-head-zero
  path, with no new runtime check, helper call, descriptor traffic or payload
  transfer. Inspect the additional append loop separately for vectorization;
  a surviving destination wrap falsifies the proposed mechanism. Preserve
  the ordinary source-head wrap and inspect all other trace/payload bodies.
- Rerun the complete practical correctness and accounting matrices, including
  checksum and cleanup faults, and require all 120 accounting rows unchanged.
  Preserve wrapped-rebase and normal/retained ownership observations. A
  changed outcome, owner order, allocation ledger or fault observability
  rejects the candidate before timing.

The same-source A/B keeps compiler inputs, toolchain, flags, harness, work
`1048576`, seeds, all seven samples and both order cohorts fixed; the sole
compiler difference is emission of the new fact. Preserve both images and
sample sets. Measure all 24 Deque application cells and all native controls,
not only scalar growth. For each remaining scalar growth cell at counts 256
and 4096, require the candidate's largest sample below the baseline's
smallest in both cohorts before selecting a repeatable improvement. Reject
selection on a useful-cell regression established by the reverse observed-
range test in both cohorts, or on a lost previously established target win.
Overlapping samples remain inconclusive; do not average cells, drop outliers,
change qualifications, or repeat a losing pair to obtain a favorable one.
Every claimed completed target cell must independently satisfy the central
[optimization criterion](../ECOSYSTEM.md#optimization-criterion): compare
against each cohort's median-slower Rust/C++ peer, require WF's largest
sample below that peer's smallest in both cohorts, paired minima at least
1 ms, cohort-ratio spread at most 10%, and native inter-arm drift at most
10% for attribution. A valid fact or improved native loop alone does not
complete a performance target. Build, correctness execution and timing remain
separate guarded stages.

### Entry-capacity native screen before execution

The first screen used the unchanged Deque fixture and library at documentation
head `262c662a46ffb06e7dc62a482ff02bfbb214e2e1`, with only the pending
Ring entry-capacity emitter change. The frozen control compiler SHA-256 is
`5753999f224f89a9a99e0399b76bfd7b92cd53d5f22b0d204df4f2ec3ffbc20b`;
the candidate is
`e7ad848067a702de0941d9c7bf61d842573ab4ef884988aeb32687c48c7a116e`.
The candidate CLI build, using the gate profile and two jobs, exited zero in
44.55 seconds. Same-source emission and native construction exited zero in
1.96 seconds. These are construction observations, not workload timings; no
generated candidate program was executed in this screen.

Both compilers ran `--emit-llvm deque-library.wf -o <output>` from this
fixture directory. The ordinary timed-module rename changed `@main(` to
`@wf_fixture_main(`. Apple Clang 21.0.0 (`clang-2100.3.34.2`), target
`arm64-apple-darwin25.6.0`, consumed each module with
`-O3 -Wno-override-module -x ir -S -emit-llvm` for optimized LLVM and the
same command without `-emit-llvm` for native assembly. No Rust/C++ peer,
driver or runtime rebuild was needed for this mechanism question.

Removing exactly four candidate raw-LLVM lines, the unsigned predicate and
its assumption in each scalar/record `place_back` body, reproduces the
control bytes without any other normalization. That ordinary module SHA-256
is `351f6de53267932d3e4a2091da4ca6a19be3d8039db91e98515fb7b8c78fd033`.
The candidate raw module is
`37acb683279e52e02174c2b3868ca0fb783766df9aff21f9c48ede99a5783c38`.
Control/candidate native assembly SHA-256 values are respectively
`fd628b4796509c8e9e42649c021c0971ad90b97d925ffccf91a9d64b4629e9e0` and
`d0112c863b4b63aaf12f6bd9b2c9760b5f3d62a1a0a4b8639605a4458d9f5089`.

The native growth loops give the following static observations. Instruction
counts describe one loop-body execution, including its backedge; they are
not elapsed-time ratios.

| Growth loop | Control | Candidate | Payload traffic per logical element |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scalar rebase | 13 instructions per element, `LBB10_40` | 10 per element, `LBB10_39` | One 8-byte load and store in each |
| Scalar additional append | 32 instructions per four elements, `LBB10_44` | 10 per eight elements, `LBB10_43` | One 8-byte store in each |
| Scalar append remainder | 9 instructions, `LBB10_47` | 6, `LBB10_46` | One 8-byte store in each |
| Record rebase | 37 instructions per element, `LBB11_21` | 35 per element, `LBB11_22` | 256 bytes loaded and stored in each |
| Record additional append | 37 instructions per element, `LBB11_24` | 124 per two elements, `LBB11_27` | 256 bytes stored in each |

Scalar rebase loses the destination comparison, select and subtraction;
source-head wrapping remains. The additional scalar append uses two paired
Q-register stores for eight values, and its scalar remainder also loses
destination wrapping. Neither loop gains a helper call, descriptor access,
payload snapshot or runtime test of the entry requirement. The existing
scalar append trip-count dispatch changes from four to eight elements as
its vector width changes. The wrapped-rebase control likewise loses only
the destination wrap in its transfer loop, from 13 to 10 instructions for
scalars and 37 to 35 for records; source wrapping is still present.

All 45 emitted native function bodies retain the same call-target multisets,
including tail calls. Thirty-nine retain identical instruction text after
excluding assembly directives, labels and comments, including all primitive
endpoints, drains, constructors, releases and element callbacks. The six
changed instruction bodies are the two complete trace instances, the two
fill instances and the two rebase instances:

| Body | Control instructions | Candidate instructions | Other observed change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Scalar trace | 476 | 465 | Total frame grows from 240 to 304 bytes |
| Record trace | 654 | 879 | Total frame grows from 448 to 832 bytes |
| Scalar fill | 69 | 66 | Ordinary head-relative wrapping remains in this shared helper |
| Record fill | 76 | 76 | Register/induction arrangement changes; wrapping remains |
| Scalar rebase | 39 | 36 | Destination wrapping removed; 48-byte frame retained |
| Record rebase | 63 | 61 | Destination wrapping removed; 48-byte frame retained |

The complete inventory corrects an earlier 33-body specialization-only count.
The twelve omitted resource helpers, callbacks, exported trace wrappers and
entry points are identical; they introduce no further changed bodies. The
corrected table includes each final operand-free `ret`, adding one to the
previously reported total in each body. The original subset artifact remains
frozen; `native-body-comparison-complete.json` in the same private home records
all 45 bodies, instruction counts and direct/tail-call targets. This accounting
correction changes neither the loop observations nor the timing disposition.

The scalar trace's initial-growth fill loop gains one `dup` instruction per
eight values. Forward/reverse hot-loop instruction counts stay at 15/19 for
scalars and 97/101 for records, without new hot stack accesses; their enclosing
trace frames still incur the reported growth. The wide additional append
introduces a two-record vector dispatch and remainder. Its vector loop has
32 zip operations and one 16-byte stack reload of the loop-invariant seed
vector per two records. That value was stored before the vector loop; this
is new controller traffic, not a copied record or descriptor. The larger
frame, setup, shuffle work and repeated seed load are costs, not an inferred
speedup. Allocation calls, payload bytes per logical element and source-head
wraps are unchanged in this inspection; the subsequent complete outcome and
allocation observations are recorded below.

The scalar native mechanism passes the prerecorded code discriminator: the
fresh-head-zero destination wrap is gone without substituted calls, entry
checks, descriptor traffic or payload movement. The criterion did not require
unchanged frame size or instruction count in every other body; the wider
code effects above must therefore proceed to the unchanged full-family
regression criterion rather than being hidden or declared harmless. This
screen selects neither the production change nor a performance result.
The focused test, practical matrix and accounting results below satisfy the
recorded correctness prerequisites for timing.

The private screen directory
`/private/tmp/whitefoot-deque-entry-capacity-screen-gwjchlar` retains both
compiler copies, source/test patches, exact criterion, input snapshots,
commands, exit statuses, construction logs, raw/optimized LLVM, assembly and
the complete body/call comparison. Its `source.patch` SHA-256 is
`1feacd3e8901aa4c2a1b54dead49b990294950e5b0235a450285ab80ec7f9cf0`;
the pre-implementation criterion snapshot is
`169f1721f8b85a0bb21826824fe1698930f48250921becd2a3ff2d2f04aa5126`.
The directory is a local artifact location, not a maintained dependency.

### Entry-capacity focused test and fixture authoring correction

The first window-test run stopped the new regression fixture at canonical
source admission, before semantic checking or native execution. Its generated
one-line `if` bodies used a space where [FORM-2] requires a newline and four
spaces; consecutive generated functions also lacked the required blank line.
Only whitespace inside the test's Whitefoot source strings was corrected.
All non-whitespace source bytes, twelve placements, three deliberately wrong
fact predicates and expected exit codes are unchanged. Neither compiler
emission nor the measured Deque source changed in this repair.

The original source and rejection remain in the screen directory's
`fixture-authoring/`: `before.wf` SHA-256 is
`3bd0358c7550339ef48290a621dbd80c0951f5062f1ed0ee03f796393d9220d4`.
The frozen candidate CLI rejected it with `FORM-2 NonCanonicalTrivia` at
line 7, column 27, exit 1. It admitted the corrected `after.wf`, SHA-256
`f61fe8814918b8873c7a4d3e30150da56ffcff03eaf4f461cabd854ad1bae397`,
with `--check`, exit 0, before rebuilding the Rust test binary. The first
test failure remains in
`/private/tmp/whitefoot-fixed-storage-swap/semantics-continuation/windows.stderr`.

The repaired gate-profile test
`ring_back_placement_entry_capacity_preserves_wrapping_and_unsigned_measures`
passed as part of the 25-test window filter, direct exit 0. It executes all
three fact observations in ordinary and retained-call forms, independently
checking order and descriptors for fixed/runtime rings, nonzero heads,
placements ending full and zero-size capacities above the signed domain.
The correct runtime observer sees twelve placements and exits 0; the signed,
post-length and head-plus-length mutations each exit 91. The test continues
to replace the new assumption with the observer before optimization, so no
false assumption serves as its fault oracle.

Primary command/status evidence is
`/private/tmp/whitefoot-fixed-storage-swap/semantics-repaired/result.json`
(SHA-256
`6ee68ef854624cfbff37289660e37acb16f331b544b3a6a7a3ac1f25dde283bd`);
the adjacent `windows.stdout` explicitly names the passing new test and has
SHA-256 `d80c8fdb23a4e1d0a65688f34b3eab491bc45ae8dd625cc62b2295ed5232f89b`.
The corrected `windows.rs` SHA-256 is
`fff6048aa86c86894fffda1363636b5029fcf0bb84f848443df0c4732538740a`.
This is focused correctness evidence, not a Deque performance result or a
production-selection verdict.

### Isolated entry-capacity correctness and accounting

The practical pair uses the frozen control and candidate compilers above,
without the later fixed-storage exchange candidate. The previously qualified
raw Deque modules supply each native arm. The unchanged O3 C driver, Rust/C++
peer and native-runtime objects are reused byte-for-byte from the recorded
`main-6bb-f` build after checking their retained identities and source hashes.
Only Whitefoot objects, links, historical O2 C-driver objects and the
maintained owning fixture's native images are constructed. No compiler, peer
or runtime rebuild and no performance timing occur in this stage.

The separate guarded build and execution stages both exit 0, in 4.24 and
4.86 seconds respectively. In each arm, the practical ordinary-allocation
and accounting images each pass 576 configurations and 2,592 executions,
including the historical wrapped-rebase control. Thus the four images pass
10,368 complete traces. Each arm's checksum and cleanup faults exit 1 with
the expected distinct messages. Timed LLVM and native symbols contain no
allocation-observer hooks.

Both allocation files contain all 120 rows across 24 application cells.
The ledgers are byte-identical to each other and to
[the retained allocation observations](ecosystem-accounting.csv), SHA-256
`0ac88c02c5e9ca9517a584cdb75236a3ce1cc09497c4bd2f1e64ae9c835a2fcc`.
Independent CSV checks also verify cell coverage, complete-checksum agreement,
balanced allocation lifetimes, Whitefoot/C request and byte formulas, and
the requested-overlap bound.

Each arm's O2 normal and retained-helper images pass 432 configurations and
1,296 executions apiece; the retained LLVM still contains 26 Whitefoot and
48 C helper call sites. The maintained `deque-program.wf` also passes with
each frozen CLI under both sequential and `--par` lowering, both with ordinary
deallocation and with its existing identity observer. Each observed image
reports exactly 21 allocations, every one released once. The practical and
both owning modules reproduce control LLVM byte-for-byte after removing
only the new fact lines.

The screen directory's `practical-matrix/` keeps the pinned inputs, reused
objects, images, commands, outputs and direct exit statuses. Its
`build/result.json` SHA-256 is
`053dcabe81bd2a561bfe2b33e897fda0fc2b05d2fcbb5ab880c74905db4035f0`;
`check/result.json` is
`ffab3032f49c9ce6df3774355f07b7b9c7d6f72de7fbc33383368269c635ac7a`.
The ordinary-allocation executable identities are
`73633cdb1f005f5c29a95386ef456170f218a02cfc60761f7cc5fa68cd984adc`
(control) and
`daff768a97e95cdfc558195933f2c24275201212c10bcc6155805616a821fd06`
(candidate). These observations qualify the isolated pair for the recorded
full-family timing experiment; they do not select the production change.

### Entry-capacity pair: scalar gains, wide regression, candidate rejected

The single preregistered control/candidate pair rejects uniform entry-capacity
fact emission. Both remaining scalar growth cells improve with complete range
separation, but 256-byte growth at 4096 has a qualified loss in both cohorts.
Its candidate/control medians are 1.028733 and 1.033201; even its smallest
candidate samples exceed the largest control samples, by factors 1.002800
and 1.007236. This violates the recorded no-regression rule. No sample is
removed and no replay or extra variant is selected.

Scalar growth falls by 10.36–10.90% at count 16, 10.04–10.37% at 256 and
6.64–7.54% at 4096. The last two still do not complete the standard-peer
target: at 256 the candidate is 1.004–1.015 times Rust and 1.228–1.232 times
C++, leaving the target inconclusive; at 4096 it is 1.185–1.192 times Rust
and 1.299–1.306 times C++, a robust deficit. The code screen correctly
predicted a scalar gain. Its wider append expansion, zip operations, seed
reload and larger frame accompanied the measured wide loss, but this pair
does not apportion the loss among those changes.

Each arm retains 1,680 rows: both cohorts, all seven samples and all five
implementations in 24 cells. The built-in warmups, work 1048576 and seeds
101–107 are unchanged. Control ran first in 48.027098 seconds, candidate
second in 48.208711 seconds; both exited 0, and the guarded timing stage took
96.40 seconds. All non-timing CSV fields match. The smallest sample across
all arms and implementations is 1.093 ms, and the smallest WF sample is
1.240 ms. Maximum candidate/control WF cohort-ratio spread is 2.746%.
Maximum inter-arm median drift is 3.391% for loop C, 3.451% for bulk C,
3.183% for Rust and 2.920% for C++. Every pair cell and every separate
standard-peer comparison satisfies the registered duration, stability and
drift screens; none of the adverse observations is excluded as unqualified.

The complete-cell result is three gains, one loss and twenty overlaps.
In the table, ratios list cohorts 0 / 1; below one means the candidate or WF
is faster than its named denominator. Pair gain/loss means complete range
separation in both cohorts. P/D/I are qualified range pass, deficit and
inconclusive, respectively; median ratios alone do not determine them.

| Bytes | Path | Count | Candidate/control, cohorts 0 / 1 | Pair | Candidate/Rust | Candidate/C++ | Slower target, control → candidate |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 8 | forward-churn | 16 | 1.0000 / 1.0167 | overlap | 0.977 / 0.990 (I) | 1.435 / 1.433 (D) | I → I |

The concurrent control has slower-standard totals 17 P / 2 D / 5 I, versus
16 P / 2 D / 6 I for the candidate. Against Rust alone they are 5 / 3 / 16
and 6 / 3 / 15; against C++ alone, 16 / 6 / 2 and 14 / 6 / 4. Wide reverse
churn at 16 loses the concurrent control's sufficient target pass, despite
its overlapping before/after samples. Wide growth at 256 becomes a robust
standard-target deficit, while its two-arm ranges overlap in one cohort.
The prior retained front-slot result was 18 / 2 / 4; its scalar forward
churn/256 pass is inconclusive in both current arms, so that historical
change cannot be attributed to this candidate. The qualified wide growth/4096
loss alone is sufficient to reject selection.

For the paired WF comparison, divide candidate by control within each cohort:
median/median gives the descriptive ratio, maximum/minimum the gain bound,
and minimum/maximum the loss bound. Both gain bounds must be below one or
both loss bounds above one. Apply the recorded minimum-duration,
cohort-ratio-spread and native-drift screens before selection. This preserves
every sample rather than comparing an average of cells.

This publication uses zero context to avoid whitespace-only context lines in
an embedded patch. The measured full-context patch remains privately frozen
as `source.patch`, SHA-256
`1feacd3e8901aa4c2a1b54dead49b990294950e5b0235a450285ab80ec7f9cf0`;
applying either patch produces identical candidate source bytes. The
published patch applies with `--unidiff-zero` to
`262c662a46ffb06e7dc62a482ff02bfbb214e2e1` and reconstructs
the two tested emitter source files exactly: `emitter.rs` has SHA-256
`d6e954969760b95017ec656670979ad2ce11b26d2d72990eeef9e807ea5e92e4`

`1f1e8c7c5b2db7b5a1111f4b5660e8bffba4044e4ebd93ea6eba5138e287daef`.
This reconstruction was checked by applying the patch to private copies of
the base files and comparing those hashes, without a new build or timing.
The patch serves reproduction of this rejected compiler experiment, remains
frozen with its result and retires with this experiment's evidence.

To reconstruct the candidate in a fresh disposable checkout, run from the
repository root; these are reproduction commands, not a rerun of this trial:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /private/tmp/deque-entry-reproduce 262c662a46ffb06e7dc62a482ff02bfbb214e2e1
git -C /private/tmp/deque-entry-reproduce apply --unidiff-zero "$PWD/research/experiments/container-representation/deque-library/ring-entry-capacity-candidate.patch"

```

The unpatched base reconstructs the control. Any new measurement requires
its own authorization and retains the full `measure 1048576 7` commands;
these commands reconstruct source and behavior, not a claim that a fresh
build reproduces the stored executable bytes or timings. The tested frozen
images and their hashes above remain the identities of this pair.

The rejected production emission and its test-only third fact mode are
withdrawn. The existing address-fact mode, its structure assertions and
ordinary wrapping arithmetic remain. The new fixed/runtime Ring behavior
source remains in `backend/tests/windows.rs` as
`ring_back_placement_preserves_wrapping_and_unsigned_measures`: its twelve
placements check full capacity, nonzero head, logical payload order and
zero-size capacities above the signed domain, through the two existing
address-fact modes with ordinary and retained calls. Its expected outcomes
and source operations are unchanged.

Only the new entry-assumption structure assertions and the runtime observer
that mutates that assumption are retired: after withdrawal their subject
no longer exists in production. They passed before the performance decision;
the twelve-observation success and signed/post-length/head-plus-length
faults, each observed with the ordinary runtime observer rather than false
LLVM assumptions, remain in the historical unit evidence above. This
retirement removes experimental assertions with their rejected optimization;
it does not revise a failed semantic expectation or suppress an existing
correctness check. The source-only FORM2 repair and its initial failure are
also retained above. Withdrawal itself has received text/pin checks, not a
separate rebuild; the shared final gate checks the resulting compiler.

## Representation-limited entry facts: native and correctness screens

The uniform candidate remains rejected. A separate isolated candidate limits
its same unsigned Ring PlaceBack entry relation to elements for which the
existing `is_stored_aggregate` classification is false. This is the emitter's
ordinary-value versus stored-payload transfer boundary, already used by
`store_value_at`; no source name, payload-size threshold or fixture identity
selects it. Primitives, Box pointers and tag-only enums use the ordinary
value path. Structs, inline Arrays, fixed windows and payload enums use the
stored path. The relation's authority remains the discharged entry
precondition, independently of that performance policy.

This boundary is deliberately coarse. A one-word struct or array can have
the same payload extent as u64 and may become the same representation after
inlining, yet remains excluded here. Direct values can also acquire costly
vectorization. The question is whether this existing representation boundary
retains the scalar improvement while avoiding the wide record's lane
rearrangement; it is not a general profitability claim or a solution to the
remaining standard-peer deficit. The proposed tree change remains pending.

The criterion was frozen before construction as `CRITERION.md`, SHA-256
`96d7af526430d7933d06a1fc558bca49fbc31acd81dcdf7b4210125959fab88f`,
in `/private/tmp/whitefoot-deque-entry-capacity-screen-gwjchlar/representation-policy-preparation/`.
It incorporates the complete 45-function inventory correction described above;
the earlier 33-specialization criterion remains preserved beside it. The
native prediction requires exactly one scalar predicate/assume pair, all
ordinary LLVM unchanged, the scalar loops from the uniform trial, every
record body equal to control, and unchanged call targets across all 45
functions. Later selection still requires strict gains at both scalar growth
counts 256 and 4096, no qualified loss or lost established target win in any
of the 24 cells, the same 120-row ledger, and separate Rust/C++ comparisons.
The original duration, cohort spread, native drift and full observed-range
rules are unchanged.

The isolated source base is `262c662a46ffb06e7dc62a482ff02bfbb214e2e1`, with
control CLI SHA-256
`5753999f224f89a9a99e0399b76bfd7b92cd53d5f22b0d204df4f2ec3ffbc20b`.
The private two-file `source.patch`, SHA-256
`3d43112697ddad29bf4a19e8ea11097309ae1e29a1821e2bba7c4dd47b23fa3b`,
adds only this emission policy and the existing test-only fact observations.
No shared compiler or library source was changed for the trial. The one
isolated gate/jobs-2 CLI build exited zero in 62.368170 seconds; its frozen
CLI is `screen/candidate-whitefootc`, SHA-256
`0dc2a0af8967fcd041fa0933f2954b6dfa0712385db879eae961a5a5300db1a0`.
The seven native-screen commands all exited zero; their guarded stage took
1.52 seconds and rebuilt neither peers nor runtime.

The native screen passes its recorded discriminator. Removing only the two
new `.entry_room` lines exactly reproduces the control raw module, including
SSA names. Control assembly is byte-identical to the earlier frozen control.
Forty-two complete instruction bodies are unchanged; only scalar trace, fill
and rebase change, and each matches the corresponding uniform-candidate
instructions and constants. All 45 direct/tail-call target multisets are
unchanged. Whole-body instruction totals, including `ret`, are 476 to 465,
69 to 66 and 39 to 36 respectively.

| Observation | Control | Representation-limited candidate |
|---|---:|---:|
| Scalar growth rebase loop | 13 instructions per element | 10 |
| Scalar additional append loop | 32 instructions per four elements | 10 per eight |
| Scalar append remainder | 9 instructions per element | 6 |
| Record growth rebase loop | 37 instructions per record | 37 |
| Record additional append loop | 37 instructions per record | 37 |
| Scalar trace frame | 240 bytes | 304 bytes |
| Record trace frame | 448 bytes | 448 bytes |

The inspected loops have no hot stack accesses. Scalar rebase and append
remove the destination wrap without new calls, source checks, descriptor
traffic or payload snapshots; source wrapping remains where required.
The scalar frame/setup costs from the uniform result remain costs. Record
append preserves within-record SIMD, avoiding the refused two-record zip
sequence and repeated seed reload. Complete instruction identity does not
establish timing identity: scalar changes can move other functions in the
image, so every wide cell remains a required timing control.

Source admission first failed on `eligibility.wf:22:45`, OWN-1 MoveOfCopy,
with direct exit 1 in 0.029754 seconds. The generated concrete fixtures had
used explicit `move` even for copy types. The source and diagnostics remain
under `screen/admit/`; original source SHA-256 is
`0a48141b2a8b947da20a87be05cce2982ea1b73947f9d6c6a6b86d76b7e71c27`.
The repair removes only `move ` in the 36 copyable roundtrips and their test
source builder, retaining it for Box/Slots/Ring values. Types, 48 cases,
eight positive eligibility expectations and all operations are unchanged.
The repaired source, SHA-256
`423f581e337111c9c6ac737410de8746786be3650f20dd8beba6d35f3f2dfa1e`,
and the unchanged twelve-placement behavior source both admitted in
`screen/admit-2/`, with direct exits zero in 0.045320/0.028066 seconds.
This authoring failure changes neither the emission patch nor the criterion.

The single isolated lib construction exited zero in 102.902999 seconds,
separate from the focused `backend::tests::windows::` execution: all 26 tests
passed, zero failed or ignored, in 8.084697 seconds. The eligibility test
covers fixed/runtime Slots and Ring over twelve element representations,
with literal expected choices rather than the classifier under test. The
behavior source retains all twelve placements, including nonzero head,
ending full, logical payload order and fixed/runtime zero-size capacities
9223372036854775809. It executes through all three fact observations and both
ordinary/retained-call forms. Only ten scalar placements receive the new
fact; the two aggregate zero-size cases retain their complete behavior
checks without that optional relation.

A runtime observer replaces the new assumptions before optimization: the
correct relation exits zero with exactly ten observations at two static
sites; reversed operands, post-length and head-plus-length each exit 91.
The unsigned operator is pinned structurally. The former signed-comparison
mutant is not an informative failure in this policy's eligible positive-stride
capacity domain, so the prerecorded reversed-operand control replaces it;
the large zero-size witnesses remain tested but are ineligible for the fact.
No deliberately false LLVM assumption is used as a fault oracle. The unit
input manifest pins 345 files; all stayed unchanged during the run.

The complete native outcome/accounting stage reuses 42 frozen control,
peer and runtime artifacts and constructs only the candidate images. All
42 relevant native-source inputs match the earlier trial; the later Rust
aggregate program-test harness differs but is not an input to this direct
WF/C owning-source recipe. Construction exited zero in 2.08 seconds and the
separate observation stage in 4.95 seconds. Each arm passes both 576-case /
2,592-execution practical images and both 432-case / 1,296-execution historical
images. Sequential and parallel owning programs pass with allocation
observers reporting 21 allocations, each released exactly once. Retained
helper sites remain present (26 WF and 48 C). Checksum and missing-cleanup
controls each exit 1 with their expected diagnostic; timed images contain
no allocation-observer hooks.

Both complete 120-row ledgers are byte-identical to the retained ledger,
SHA-256 `0ac88c02c5e9ca9517a584cdb75236a3ce1cc09497c4bd2f1e64ae9c835a2fcc`.
The control timed image remains
`73633cdb1f005f5c29a95386ef456170f218a02cfc60761f7cc5fa68cd984adc`;
the limited candidate image is
`2741bd0dcdc4184e4cbee63e697939393a925fe1464237525df15ac9ed21a67d`.
These screens justify the registered complete timing pair, not selection.
The subsequent complete pair is recorded below; these observations precede it.

Primary evidence below is relative to the private preparation directory;
its manifests retain exact argv, direct statuses, streams and input hashes.

## Representation-limited pair: scalar gains, historical target unresolved

The single preregistered pair has three qualified gains, no qualified losses
and 21 overlaps. Both required scalar growth populations improve: count 256
by 10.30/10.23 percent and count 4096 by 7.16/6.98 percent in cohorts 0/1.
No contemporaneous control target pass is lost. The result nevertheless
keeps `recommend_select=false`: the historical scalar forward-churn pass at
count 256 is absent in both current arms. This leaves the registered
historical-target condition unresolved; it is not evidence of a regression
caused by this candidate. The representation-limited mechanism remains a
pending proposal, with no shared compiler change selected. The separate
uniform candidate's qualified wide loss and refusal remain unchanged.

The frozen control and candidate images identified above each ran exactly
`measure 1048576 7`, control first and candidate second. Both direct exits
were zero, in 48.010326 and 47.927807 seconds; the guarded pair took 96.09
seconds. Each arm retains all 1,680 rows: 24 application cells, five
implementations, seven samples and two cohorts. The unchanged driver warms
each implementation at seed 97 with one sixteenth of the work, clamped to a
nonzero quantity, checks those outcomes without emitting them as samples,
then records seeds 101 through 107. All non-timing fields match between
arms, and all 47 frozen input identities remained unchanged. No compiler,
peer or runtime rebuild occurred, no interim rankings were inspected, and
no rerun or threshold change followed the result.

The original rule requires strict complete-range gains in both scalar
growth 256 and 4096 in both cohorts, no qualified useful-cell loss and no
lost established target win. A paired gain means candidate maximum is below
control minimum in each cohort; a paired loss uses the reverse separation.
Every cell must also pass the 1 ms minimum, at most ten percent cohort-ratio
spread and at most ten percent native-control drift screens. The smallest
sample is 1.093 ms, the smallest WF sample 1.240 ms, maximum paired ratio
spread 3.8362 percent, and maximum native drift 5.5556 percent. Maximum
absolute drift is 3.0281 percent for loop C, 3.9508 for bulk C, 4.9320 for
Rust and 5.5556 for C++; no individual peer qualification fails. All 192
native drift rows and all 96 separate Rust/C++ comparisons are retained.

The complete table uses median time ratios, with both cohorts shown in
order. `P` means full observed-range separation in WF's favor, `D` separation
against WF, and `I` inconclusive. The target chooses the median-slower
standard container per cohort; individual Rust/C++ columns remain separate.
An overlapping pair is not a demonstrated equality or a gain.

The slower-standard counts are control 17 P / 2 D / 5 I and candidate
17 P / 1 D / 6 I, versus historical retained 18 P / 2 D / 4 I. Separately,
the candidate is 6 P / 2 D / 16 I against Rust and 16 P / 5 D / 3 I against
C++; the control is 7 P / 3 D / 14 I and 16 P / 6 D / 2 I respectively.
Scalar growth 256 changes from deficit to overlap, not to a target pass.
Scalar growth 4096 still costs 1.1832/1.1834 times Rust and 1.2965/1.2986
times C++. Wide growth 4096 overlaps its control at 0.9998/1.0038; the
uniform candidate's wide loss is not reproduced by this limited policy.

For the historical scalar forward-churn 256 cell, the current WF
candidate/control medians are 0.9976/1.0000, with overlapping ranges and
2.0110 percent maximum native drift. The slower peer is Rust in both
cohorts. Its WF/peer observed upper bounds are 1.018018/0.999399 in the
control and 1.024654/0.986170 in the candidate, whereas the historical
bounds were 0.987365/0.986161. Thus both current arms lose the historical
complete-range pass through cohort 0 overlap, and neither shows a qualified
WF loss in the current pair. The original historical condition is retained,
not replaced with the weaker contemporaneous condition. Any later comparison
against final current main needs its own prospective criterion and images;
this pair alone neither resolves that condition nor justifies rejecting the
mechanism as causally regressive.

It contains only the two production source files; the private focused test
patch and its passing input manifest are identified in the preceding stage.
The publication patch uses zero context, while private `source.patch`
remains unchanged at SHA-256
`3d43112697ddad29bf4a19e8ea11097309ae1e29a1821e2bba7c4dd47b23fa3b`.
Applying either to `262c662a46ffb06e7dc62a482ff02bfbb214e2e1`
reconstructs exactly the tested `emitter.rs` SHA-256

This was checked by applying the publication patch to private base-file
copies and comparing source hashes, without a new build. It serves
reconstruction of the isolated policy and retires with this experiment.

For a fresh disposable checkout, the explicit reconstruction commands are:

The unpatched base reconstructs the control source. These commands do not
claim fresh executable identity, reproduce the private focused test patch,
or authorize another measurement; the frozen image hashes above identify
this completed pair. No specification, source acceptance, boundary row,
library API or allocation policy changes in this candidate.


### Remaining margins and retained native work

The following is a read-only reduction of the completed pair and inspection
of its retained code, not another trial. These are all seven unresolved
slower-standard targets in the candidate arm. The upper quotient is WF's
maximum divided by that cohort's median-slower peer's minimum, so a complete
range pass needs both entries below one. These margins describe the stored
samples, not a prediction of the gain a later change would deliver.

| Bytes | Path | Count | Slower peer | Upper quotient, cohorts 0 / 1 | Current target |
|---:|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| 8 | forward-churn | 16 | Rust | 1.070439 / 1.016081 | I |
| 8 | forward-churn | 256 | Rust | 1.024654 / 0.986170 | I |
| 8 | forward-churn | 4096 | Rust | 1.044883 / 1.043686 | I |
| 8 | growth | 256 | Rust | 1.008128 / 1.025467 | I |
| 8 | growth | 4096 | Rust | 1.208110 / 1.198423 | D |
| 256 | growth | 256 | C++ | 1.012591 / 1.027223 | I |
| 256 | growth | 4096 | C++ | 1.011751 / 1.024694 | I |

The source-policy distinction remains material. WF's growth trace explicitly
allocates `count`, fills it, rebases into a fresh `2*count+1` backing, appends
`count+1` values, drains in order and releases. Its
[`deque_rebase`](../../../../lib/std/collections/deque/deque.wf) transfers each
element through `take_front` and `place_back`. The C loop control has the
same allocation policy and layout; the bulk C control changes only that
conversion to at most two `memcpy` spans. Rust pushes into `VecDeque` and
uses automatic growth; C++ uses segmented `std::deque` without reserve.
Those standard containers do not implement WF's explicit fresh-backing
operation, so their timings cannot isolate its lowering cost.

There is nevertheless a residual against the same-policy C loop: scalar
growth 256 is 1.2843/1.2818 times loop C and 1.6490/1.6484 times bulk C;
scalar growth 4096 is 1.2794/1.2886 and 1.6728/1.6796 respectively. The wide
results are different: at 256, WF is 0.9905/0.9901 times loop C and
1.0693/1.0702 times bulk C; at 4096, 0.9842/0.9949 and 1.0431/1.0516.
Thus allocation-policy differences alone cannot explain the scalar C-loop
gap, and a wide compiler penalty cannot be inferred from the standard-peer
gap when WF already has lower medians than this source-loop control.

Frozen scalar growth code narrows the remaining work:

| Loop | WF limited candidate | C loop control |
|---|---:|---:|
| Initial-to-fresh rebase | 10 instructions per element | 27 per five elements |
| Additional append | 10 per eight elements | 32 per four elements |
| Final drain | 9 per element | 6 per element |

WF rebase keeps a loop-carried source head, increment, unsigned comparison,
conditional capacity selection and subtraction; destination wrapping is
already gone. C's head successor uses equality and `csinc`, and its transfer
loop is unrolled five times. WF's drain similarly retains the more general
head-wrap form and an extra address addition; both drains keep the required
checksum dependency. These loops have no helper calls, descriptor reloads
or hot stack accesses. WF's faster append form therefore does not establish
that its transfer and drain work are equivalent to C's. Static instruction
counts and the full-trace pair do not apportion their elapsed cost.

The retained Rust scalar body still performs capacity checks and descriptor
stack stores on pushes, calls `VecDeque::grow` when full, and drains with
nine instructions per element. Its growth helper calls `RawVec::grow_one`
and conditionally repairs wrapped storage with `memmove` or `memcpy`; the
head-zero fixture follows the branch that needs no wrapped-storage repair.
Reallocation can still move data, which this instruction inspection and
requested-byte ledger do not measure. C++ computes a block-table index and
within-block offset, adds capacity when needed, and frees blocks as the
front crosses a block boundary. These are policy and representation
tradeoffs, not evidence that the WF transfer loop costs no time because its
request count is lower.

For the existing three-round growth-4096 ledger, scalar WF and both C
controls each make six requests and six releases, request 295,080 bytes,
and have 98,360 peak requested bytes. Rust makes nine requests including six
reallocations, releases three final allocations, requests 688,128 bytes,
and peaks at 131,072; C++ makes/releases 69 requests, requests 210,408 bytes,
and peaks at 70,016. These are logical allocator observations, not physical
memory or a division of the measured runtime into allocation and copying.
The complete wide and other-cell accounting remains in the unchanged
120-row ledger.

The bounded next lowering question is the Ring front-removal successor:
can its one-step normalized origin use an equality/select form instead of
the general offset-wrap subtraction, reducing transfer/drain dependencies
without supplying a new fact or changing the bulk-transfer API? This is a
prospective opportunity, not an implemented or timed candidate. Before
construction it needs a complete domain argument for every origin writer,
including fixed/runtime storage, capacity one, nonzero head and maximal
zero-size capacities. The frontend's published `head <= cap` fact alone is
not a proof of the backend's strict normalized-head invariant. A cheap
screen would falsify the idea if the scalar successor sequence or drain
remains unchanged, or if wide code acquires the refused shuffle/spill cost;
any surviving form still needs semantic/fault, full accounting and complete
family performance controls. Bulk transfer is a separate algorithm/API
question and is not authorized by this observation.

The subsequent [ordinary-call boundary analysis](../../../../docs/todo.md)
closes the raw-head equality-only candidate: the published `head <= cap`
contract admits `head == cap`, for which that successor can exceed capacity.
The [boundary regression](../../../../compiler/src/backend/tests/windows.rs)
therefore normalizes only TakeFront's physical address and preserves its
numerical head update. The earlier native counts remain observations; this
raw-head successor is not a valid next optimization under the current contract.

The read-only native record is `residual-diagnosis/loop-observations.json`
under the private preparation directory, SHA-256
`b87e2092dff9addc16ed10cd1051c024b8bf52f972899ad0ac7647c9df0fb598`.
It pins the existing candidate assembly, timed image and C driver object;
C object SHA-256 is
`41784651edd4c6aebdaed30cd5cb6af83c88177be16b01a4cb7c6cb94560f3fc`.
The C-loop spans are `0x3d30..0x3d98`, `0x3e14..0x3e90` and
`0x3ee0..0x3ef4` in `_word_loop_library_trace`; WF spans are
`LBB10_39`, `LBB10_43` and `LBB10_48` in the pinned candidate assembly.
The same WF loop forms and counts are also present in the actual timed
image at `0x10000612c..0x100006150`, `0x1000061a0..0x1000061c4` and
`0x100006200..0x100006220`. The Rust/C++ descriptions come from `otool -tvV` on the same frozen timed
image, with direct disassembly exit zero. No executable was run for this
inspection.
