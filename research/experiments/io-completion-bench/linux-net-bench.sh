#!/bin/sh
# The TCP echo protocol of io-completion-bench. It builds the compiler and the
# three C tools from one worktree, builds the Whitefoot server from the same
# compiler, and prints one table: for every connection count and every server
# line, the median round-trip rate, latency and connect time over the recorded
# passes, and the Whitefoot line's ratio to each reference.
#
# Two hosts run it and neither is privileged over the other: this repository's
# `linux-net` target runs it here with the Makefile's paths, and the project's
# continuous-integration runner exports ROOT, OUT, CLANG and CARGO_TARGET_DIR
# and runs the same bytes. Only the paths differ.
#
#   sh linux-net-bench.sh          build everything and run the protocol
#   sh linux-net-bench.sh verify   only the correctness pass, over binaries
#                                  another build already put in $OUT
#   sh linux-net-bench.sh verify-client   qualify NETLOAD's bounded service
#                                  against the selected echo references
#
# The bar this measures against is the one
# research/investigations/io-model/NETWORK.md section 6 sets: the reference is
# the fastest existing solution regardless of language, which on a Linux
# loopback is a hand-written C server on io_uring using what the kernel offers
# for exactly this shape. `uring_echo` is that server, `epoll_echo` is the
# second reference, and Whitefoot's number is a ratio to them. The gap is the
# result, not something to hide.

# The round-trip counts are chosen so one run is roughly a second at 64

# work: 20000 round trips on the single connection, 2000 on each of 64, 200 on
# each of 1024. The fourth case is the bytes-per-second one: 64 KiB messages,
# 200 round trips per connection over 64 connections.
