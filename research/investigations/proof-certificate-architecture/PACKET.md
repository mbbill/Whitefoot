# Proof-certificate architecture decision packet

Status: **final**

Research task: `0049-proof-certificate-architecture`

Date: 2026-08-10

Priority order: architectural clarity, correctness, compile-time performance

## Decision

Do **not** replace the current entailment implementation with an untrusted
complete producer plus a fully independent exact verifier now.

Retain one canonical, deterministic completeness engine for the normative
least-closure result, accepted-program set, claim lifecycle, canonical
residuals, and first diagnostic. The immediate prerequisite is a bounded
DIAG-2 conformance repair: make that engine retain a canonical exact derivation
for every accepted subscript, every discharged call goal, and every S11 fact of
every `for_stmt`. That is a complete required derivation ledger, including S11
facts not used by a later query, not merely a sample of useful proof roots. The
same parent-recording machinery may additionally retain observational
used-premise witnesses for redundant claims, refuted predicates, and
contradictions used by those judgments. It must not cause a second closure
pass.

After complete shadow inventory proves that every relevant occurrence and
incoming edge is represented, the same canonical engine should atomically seal
the successful checked unit, required derivations, and complete authorization
inventory into one private `EntailmentApprovedProgram<'unit>` that lowering
must consume. That intermediate gate makes authority local and exhaustive,
although it does not shrink the TCB: the complete engine is still the issuer.

The recommended responsibility graph, even if no independent verifier is ever
promoted, is:

```text
checked semantic unit
    -> one canonical proof-flow normalization
    -> one deterministic complete entailment authority
    -> complete EntailmentResult
         -> outcome vector -> canonical acceptance and diagnostics
         -> complete DIAG-2 derivation ledger -> checked-program evidence
         -> optional used-premise witnesses -> audit/provenance consumers
         -> complete site, call, ingress, and entry inventory
              -> atomic seal -> EntailmentApprovedProgram -> lowering
```

This is a target boundary, not the migration order: required derivation
recording and complete inventory come first, and the shared normalization is
extracted only after those measurements show which information is actually
needed.

A later split remains promising, but only in this narrower form:

```text
checked semantic unit
    -> trusted, syntax-directed ProofFlow extraction
    -> one deterministic complete entailment producer
         -> complete outcomes -> canonical acceptance and diagnostics
         -> required positive certificates and complete inventories
    -> small positive verifier + atomic publisher
         -> the same lifetime-bound EntailmentApprovedProgram
    -> lowering
```

The trusted extractor, positive verifier, and atomic publisher may eventually
replace the canonical engine as the *joint issuer* of that same lowering
capability. None is sufficient alone: the verifier cannot detect an occurrence
or incoming edge omitted by its trusted extractor, and a valid set of local
proofs grants no authority until publication is complete and failure-atomic.
This path still cannot become the sole authority for exact source acceptance:
an absent proof does not prove non-derivability. The canonical engine therefore
remains responsible for completeness unless a future bounded experiment finds
a non-derivability certificate that covers the complete flow semantics without
recreating the analyzer.

This is a deliberate **defer** decision for the full producer/verifier split,
not an endorsement of the current tangle. It preserves the status-quo language
semantics while selecting a staged route by which a materially smaller verifier
can earn lowering authority. Research alone authorizes no implementation.

## Why this is the decision

Three findings decide the result.

First, the normative result contains negative information. A small checker can
validate a derivation of

```text
F in closure(State at p)
```

but an absent or invalid certificate does not establish

```text
F not in closure(State at p).
```

That missing half controls source behavior. An obligation either discharges or
rejects; a call goal is exactly `discharged`, `refuted`, or `unproved`; a claim
is exactly `redundant`, `refuted`, or `retained`; and refutation additionally
requires non-contradiction and absence of a positive derivation. A verifier
that validates all of those outcomes must validate the complete state after
every source, kill, join, and loop rule. That is a second entailment analyzer,
not a small proof kernel.

Second, most of the implementation complexity is not algebraic closure. In the
active v0.26 implementation, the entailment and goal core is 4,922 lines; the
structured flow walk and source logic alone are 3,649 lines, while the local
`close` routine occupies roughly `state.rs:333-450`. Term and goal identity,
effect-projected kills, origin validity, join coverage, scope exits, and the two
loop rules remain safety-critical even if transitivity is checked from a short
path. Trusting producer-supplied versions of those facts would only rename the
TCB.

Third, recomputing closure would duplicate the measured dominant work and is
presumptively disproportionate. On the active implementation, release profiles
of two real compilation units put 96.8% and 99.3% of samples below
`semantic::entailment::state::close`. Hashing ordered term pairs accounts for
most self time. The implementation also performs the ordinary acceptance walk
plus unasserted and S4-blinded counterfactual walks for observational
provenance. No second closure implementation or incremental overhead has been
measured, so rejection must ultimately rest on a prototype measurement against
an owner-frozen budget. A sparse positive verifier can avoid a second closure,
but it cannot remove the producer's existing cost by itself.

The result is a clean responsibility split rather than the misleading claim
that one small verifier can certify every property of compilation. In the
conditional path, the safety conclusion belongs jointly to the trusted
extractor, verifier, and failure-atomic publisher.

| Responsibility | Canonical completeness path | Conditional positive-authority path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact normative least closure | Canonical engine | Canonical engine; the verifier does not recompute it |
| Exact accepted-program set | Canonical engine | Canonical engine |
| `refuted` versus `unproved` | Canonical engine | Verifier can validate a negative relation proof, not the complete disposition |
| `redundant` versus `retained` | Canonical engine | Verifier can validate redundancy, not non-derivability |
| Canonical residual and first rejection | Canonical engine | Canonical engine |
| Complete DIAG-2 derivation retention | Engine plus atomic checked-program publication | Trusted extractor, verifier, and atomic publisher jointly |
| No invalid bounds-check omission | Engine issues the capability only after complete bounds inventory | Trusted extractor, verifier, and atomic publisher jointly |
| No unjustified ordinary-call/S4 admission | Engine issues only after complete call, ingress, and entry inventory | Trusted extractor, verifier, and atomic publisher jointly |
| Binding proof to the exact lowering site | One `EntailmentApprovedProgram` gate | The same gate; only its issuer changes |

## Authority and scope

The owner separately approved this bounded research on 2026-08-10. It advances
the questions under Direction Outline items `PROOF-1`, `PROOF-8`, and
`VERIFY-3`, but it does not change their status or authorize implementation.

This packet may recommend internal compiler architecture only. It does not
authorize:

- a language rule, proof rule, fact source, or accepted-program change;
- source-level proof terms or external proof inputs;
- an SMT result as semantic authority;
- a serialized checked-program or certificate format;
- artifact replay, caching, portable identities, or a proof protocol;
- changes to claims, conformance verdicts, the active specification, the
  Current Plan, the Direction Outline, approvals, or MCTS-Mem.

The repository's live design memory fixes two important boundaries:

- check removal requires a deterministic machine proof, and unproved source
  obligations do not silently acquire implicit runtime checks
  (`mcts_mem/whitefoot/checks-and-proofs/obligation-discharge.md`);
- the private checked in-memory program is the sole lowering authority, with no
  current serialized or replayed authority
  (`mcts_mem/whitefoot/toolchain/semantic-artifact-authority.md`).

An earlier independent *production semantic verifier* was rejected because it
duplicated the complete language while still requiring producer-to-artifact
consistency. The possible future verifier in this packet is narrower: it sees
only one trusted normalized proof-flow input, checks the positive proofs
required by the complete DIAG-2 and lowering inventories, and has no parsing,
type, ownership, diagnostic, serialization, or full closure responsibility.
The prototype must demonstrate that this distinction is real rather than
verbal.

## Revision boundary

The research worktree was created from
`b11e22f1901dc9e59cac79a9250d709e4a2082a8` and received an exact file snapshot
of task 0048's then-uncommitted candidate. Commit
`441cd5b833096d558549bb09aeecfcfe63340584` subsequently installed those exact
compiler and specification bytes as active v0.26, specification SHA-256
`18aa00e307642e608f2a3406642db9980dd3620291a7e434985e20a65eb0e476`.
Blob comparison confirmed that the implementation inspected and profiled in
the initial worktree is the implementation that landed. Commit
`d495d8ccfc14d6089987a77a7728cf2d01121027` then recorded the paired
requirement-enforcement design re-decision without changing compiler or
specification bytes.

Commit `b88248454ee5ecab8d7d0b8f2f1629be8b49baab` made task 0048
terminal. Commit `df55e7ca60e14fd32983738c92cef4528f0eda0c` then separately
selected the Stage 5b provenance plan, and task 0049 was rebased exactly onto
that revision before finalization. From `d495d8c` through `df55e7c`, the only
changed paths are the Current Plan, Direction Outline, task-0048 record, and
obligation-discharge acceptance record. The `compiler/` tree and active
specification blob are byte-identical between `441cd5b8` and `df55e7c`; the
MCTS tree is byte-identical between `d495d8c` and `df55e7c`. The active
specification still hashes to
`18aa00e307642e608f2a3406642db9980dd3620291a7e434985e20a65eb0e476`.
Therefore the landed authority refresh changes neither the implementation and
line references inspected here nor the binary used by the final measurements.
The newly ACTIVE Stage 5b plan is separate work and grants this research no
implementation authority.

## Current pipelines

### Historical v0.25

```text
syntax, resolution, type, ownership, and effect checking
    -> executable callee-entry requires prologue
    -> one entailment walk per concrete function
    -> OP-4 / CLM-2 rejection when applicable
    -> private CheckedProgram
    -> lowering emits requires then body
    -> index IR with no source bounds branch
    -> backend inbounds address calculation and load/store
```

The ordinary call does not statically prove the callee requirement in v0.25;
the callee executes it. Accepted OP-4 subscripts nevertheless lower without a
runtime bounds branch.

### Active v0.26

```text
Phase A: complete concrete function inventory
    -> requires becomes GoalTemplate, not an ordinary callee prologue
    -> calls retain pre-transfer actual images
Phase B: install concrete call requirements
    -> combined L0 + signed-goal entailment
         -> OP-4 obligation outcomes
         -> FN-8 call-goal outcomes
         -> CLM-2 claim outcomes
    -> deterministic first rejection
    -> observational O3 provenance
         -> unasserted entailment rewalk
         -> S4-blinded entailment rewalk
         -> dependency and bridge fixed points
    -> private CheckedProgram
    -> ordinary lowering emits only the function body
    -> program entry evaluates its goal once
    -> index IR still has no source bounds branch
```

This is a meaningful semantic improvement over an executable prologue, but it
raises the importance of explicit proof authority: every ordinary call now
relies on static goal discharge, and each callee body begins with S4 as a
conditional axiom.

## Current TCB and the architectural problem

### Identity

The current safety result depends on all of the following identities being
right:

- concrete function instance;
- exact checked program point, including the phase before or after a transfer,
  set commit, claim establishment, scope exit, or join;
- obligation occurrence `(function instance, psuffix NodePath, 0)`;
- requirement occurrence `(function instance, final-check NodePath, 0)`;
- call occurrence `(caller instance, call NodePath)`;
- L0 terms: zero, mathematical constants, concrete const parameters, resolved
  places with ordered field/deref projections, lengths, and counted captures;
- exact typed goals, including operation row, type and const arguments, result
  type, argument order, and datum identity;
- named constants, which deliberately keep declaration identity inside opaque
  goals but fold to their mathematical value in L0;
- ephemeral actual values, scoped to caller instance, call occurrence,
  argument ordinal, type, and remaining projections.

`NodePath` alone is not a proof point. Actual-expression obligations precede a
call goal; the call goal precedes argument consume and callee writes; set target
and right-hand-side judgments precede commit; a claim is judged before its own
S3 fact; and scope kills precede joins. Any proof representation needs a
compiler-owned phase or event identity in addition to its source occurrence.

### Facts, flow, and closure

The active analyzer currently owns, in one broad implementation path:

- term and goal reconstruction and interning;
- S1-S11 source recognition;
- comparison, goal, and outcome origins;
- alias/holder support and effect-projected kills;
- scope exits and consume order;
- closure, contradiction, and subsumption;
- joins and reachability filtering;
- ordinary-loop continuing-kill summaries;
- counted preheader materialization and S11;
- bounds obligations, call goals, claims, and residual rendering.

This makes proof discovery, proof validity, diagnostic policy, and publication
authority difficult to distinguish during review.

Closure itself is an on-demand least fixed point over a `HashMap` of ordered
term pairs. Joins close every input and materialize common results. A crucial
semantic detail follows: a closure-derived fact is normally only a query view.
It cannot be carried past a later kill merely because the derived conclusion's
endpoints survive. Joins and the counted S11 preheader are the two deliberate
materialization boundaries. A proof format that treats every derived relation
as a live flow fact is unsound.

### Outcomes are not certificates

The active implementation retains:

- a bounds `ObligationOutcome` with a boolean `discharged`, a contradiction
  flag, and an optional residual;
- call evidence categories such as `OpaquePositive` and
  `ExactL0Projection`;
- claim lifecycle outcomes;
- observational provenance witnesses.

It does not retain the exact derivations required by active DIAG-2. The defect
has three independently mandatory parts:

- every accepted subscript must retain its exact ENT-4 derivation;
- every discharged ordinary-call goal must retain its concrete substitution
  and exact derivation, while today's `CallGoalEvidence` values are only
  categories of possible grounds;
- every `for_stmt` must retain the complete ENT-4 derivation of each S11 fact,
  including facts not used by a later obligation.

Lowering also consumes neither a local proof nor a local authorization. These
are landed conformance defects, not an optional evidence improvement. This
research records their required scope but does not itself authorize or
implement the repair; owner discretion concerns sequencing and task authority,
not whether DIAG-2 applies.

### Actual no-check authority is global and implicit

Array, buffer, and slice index lowering assumes semantic success and emits a
plain index operation. The IR variants carry the value and a separate
target-domain representability obligation, but no source-discharge ID or proof
handle. The backend then emits direct `getelementptr inbounds` and load/store
operations without a source bounds branch.

The actual authorization today is therefore:

> Complete semantic checking published a `CheckedProgram`; any index node
> found inside it is assumed to have been discovered and discharged correctly.

That boundary is failure-atomic, but not local. A missing obligation-discovery
case, a stale `discharged = true`, or a mismatch between occurrence identity
and lowering can silently become a checkless address operation. This is the
strongest reason to investigate the lifetime-bound
`EntailmentApprovedProgram` gate.

### O3 is observational and should remain separate

Active O3 provenance recomputes entailment without S2/S3 and again without
S4, then solves dependency and bridge fixed points. It currently affects
neither acceptance nor lowering. It should not enter a positive safety verifier
until a later approved gate gives it a semantic consequence. Its current
rewalk cost is a performance concern, not a reason to enlarge the proof kernel.

## Three possible verifier envelopes

### Envelope A: algebra-only checker

The producer supplies a relation path or signed-goal witness. The checker
validates endpoints, weights, transitivity, and exact goal projection, while
trusting the producer's source availability, dominance, support, kills, joins,
and loops.

This can be small and linear in certificate size, but it cannot independently
authorize check omission. A forged source fact or omitted kill passes. Reject
this envelope as a safety boundary; it is suitable only for observational
explanations.

### Envelope B: trusted ProofFlow plus sparse positive verifier

One syntax-directed extractor converts the already checked semantic unit into
an internal, lifetime-bound `ProofFlow` containing:

- canonical point and edge identities;
- the exact term and goal universe;
- typed source events and their availability point;
- kill events, scope exits, and resolved overlap classes;
- exact join predecessor inventories;
- ordinary and counted loop structure;
- obligations, call goals, and claim queries.

The producer computes the exact normative result and emits sparse proof paths,
but its coverage is complete over the required inventory: every accepted
subscript, every discharged call goal, every S11 fact, and every positive root
that will authorize lowering. The verifier validates liveness, join coverage,
loop carry, algebraic steps, contradictions, and complete coverage of every
inventoried item. It does not compute the full closure or choose diagnostics.

This is the only future split not ruled out by the current evidence. The
extractor remains in the safety TCB. It succeeds only if it is one canonical
normalization used by both producer and verifier and is substantially easier
to audit than the current interleaved analyzer. Producer-emitted, unchecked
events do not qualify.

### Envelope C: independent exact verifier

The verifier walks `CheckedProgram`, independently reconstructs identities,
sources, origins, support, kills, CFG reachability, joins, loops, closure,
contradiction, every negative outcome, and deterministic diagnostics.

This duplicates the analyzer and the measured hot path. Reject it now. It is
the same architectural failure that the older complete production-verifier
alternative warned about, even if the interchange object is in memory rather
than serialized.

## Recommended near-term derivation ledger

The mandatory repair should be specialized to the current fragment rather than
introducing a general theorem language.

### Contents

The required root set is exhaustive over every accepted subscript, discharged
call goal, and S11 fact. The same arena may add observational roots for other
positive or refuting outcomes. Each root refers to canonical used premises:

- one source or implicit fact identity;
- one path of difference-bound edges for an L0 bound;
- the two paths for equality;
- a zero-bound path plus an exact disequality for strengthening;
- an exact signed opaque source, or an exact comparison-root projection;
- a negative self-bound or opposite signed-goal pair for contradiction;
- explicit predecessor coverage where a fact is materialized by a join;
- an explicit counted-preheader snapshot marker when S11 materializes closure;
- stable query identity for the obligation, call, claim, or contradiction.

The engine should record parent choices while it performs its existing work.
It must not rerun closure merely to reconstruct a proof. Proof nodes should
refer to compiler-owned dense identities in the same checked unit; no hash,
serialization, schema negotiation, or portable name is required.

### What the Stage-1 ledger does not do

- It does not shrink the TCB.
- It does not authorize lowering.
- It does not certify `unproved` or `retained` by absence.
- It does not replace the canonical result.
- It does not become optimizer evidence.
- It does not include O3's seedless fixed-point absence claims.

Its mandatory purpose is to retain the exact derivations required by DIAG-2.
It also establishes whether every such derivation has a compact, stable,
correctly invalidated representation and measures the real cost. If compact
representation fails, the independent-verifier direction stops early; the
conformance obligation does not disappear.

## Worked certificate

Consider the proof obligation `i < len(values)` under established facts
`i < n` and `n = len(values)`.

Let the exact query point immediately before the subscript be `q`.

```text
ti = Place(binding_i, [], u64)
tn = Place(binding_n, [], u64)
tl = Length(Place(binding_values, []))

O  = (concrete function instance, subscript psuffix NodePath, conjunct 0)
goal(O) = ti - tl <= -1
```

The source facts are:

```text
F1: ti - tn <= -1
    source: S1 true edge of ilt(i, n)
    support: {i, n}

F2a: tn - tl <= 0
F2b: tl - tn <= 0
     source: S6 length equality
     support: {n, values root, holders used to reach values}
```

The difference graph orients `a - b <= c` as `b -> a` with weight `c`:

```text
E1: tn -> ti, weight -1, from F1
E2: tl -> tn, weight  0, from F2a

path: tl -> tn -> ti
sum:  0 + (-1) = -1
root O: ti - tl <= -1
```

A future Envelope-B verifier must check more than the arithmetic:

1. `ti`, `tn`, and `tl` are the exact normalized terms of this checked unit.
2. F1 is available only on the true edge of the exact condition.
3. F2a is available only after the exact S6 source.
4. Both premises are live at `q`.
5. Any intervening join covers every reaching noncontradictory predecessor.
6. No intervening write, projected callee write, consume, or scope exit kills
   either premise.
7. Edge endpoints compose and the mathematical sum proves the exact relation.
8. `O` names the exact checked subscript and no other occurrence.
9. Every checkless source subscript in the accepted unit has exactly one
   verified authorization before lowering begins.

### Required invalidations

`set n = ...` judges its target and right-hand-side obligations before commit.
After commit it kills both F1 and F2a; a later certificate cannot cite either.

A user call that writes through an actual projected from `&uniq n` judges its
own actual obligations and call goal before the call effects. On normal return,
the projected `writes` kill invalidates F1 and F2a.

Consuming `n` kills both facts. Consuming `values` kills the length premise.
Leaving the scope of `n`, `values`, or a holder read through by the length term
kills the corresponding premise before any join.

An element write `values[k] = ...` is the necessary counterexample: it does not
kill a fixed `len(values)` observation. A write replacing the whole root, or a
callee write whose projection can replace that root, does. The verifier must
use the same resolved-place overlap and fixed-length boundary as ENT-5, not a
string prefix or a blanket "any write" rule.

Finally, the derived result at `q` is query-local. It cannot itself flow past a
later kill. Only a join result or the counted S11 preheader snapshot may
materialize a closure consequence as a new live fact.

## Hard semantic cases

### Claims

A claim is judged before its own S3 establishment, so it cannot prove itself.
`redundant` requires a positive proof; `refuted` requires a negative proof plus
non-contradiction; `retained` is an absence result owned by the completeness
engine. Every accepted claim still executes in all build modes, even when a
positive witness proves it redundant. A proof is never an elision token for a
claim.

### Joins

A used fact at a join must account for the exact reaching predecessor set.
Contradictory predecessors impose no constraint. For bounds, individual
predecessors may prove stronger constants and the join keeps the weakest. Exact
disequalities and opaque signed facts must be present on every applicable
input; a goal derivable through an L0 projection is not interchangeable with a
live opaque fact. An empty join is contradictory under the current rules.

### Contradiction

Contradiction is either an L0 negative self-bound or both signs of one exact
goal. It makes every query derivable and prevents refutation. A certificate
must cite the contradiction and its liveness; producer assertion of an
`all_derivable` bit is not evidence. The unreachable/contradictory state is
absorbing across later kills, so the proof-flow representation must preserve
that rule deliberately.

### Ordinary loops

There is no induction. A loop head receives only pre-loop live facts whose
support survives every continuing kill. A future verifier must derive the
continuing set from the normalized control graph, not trust an unchecked
producer summary. Facts established in one iteration do not carry to the next.

### Counted loops

The order is semantically load-bearing:

1. capture both endpoints and establish S11 preheader facts;
2. close and deliberately materialize that preheader state;
3. subtract continuing kills;
4. establish the two true-header S11 bounds at body entry.

A certificate language without a distinct counted snapshot/materialization
step cannot represent already accepted cases faithfully.

### Calls, recursion, and entry

Each ordinary call proves one concrete instantiated goal before transfer and
callee effects. The callee body then checks under its own S4 axiom. Direct and
mutual recursion therefore use ordinary local contract reasoning at each edge;
they do not need a cyclic entailment proof summary. The authorization inventory
must enumerate the complete actual incoming-edge set of every body that uses
S4. Each such edge is either an accepted ordinary call with its exact
discharged-goal derivation or a real dynamic entry with its retained entry-goal
evaluation and wrapper/check record. An omitted edge prevents publication.

### Generics and constants

Certificates bind to concrete instances after type, const, and region
substitution. A raw const-parameter declaration identity cannot authorize an
executable judgment across instances. Goal identity retains named-constant
declarations, while L0 projection uses their mathematical values; conversion
between those domains is trusted normalization and must be tested explicitly.

### Ephemeral actuals

An actual value with no ordinary source datum is identified by its caller,
call occurrence, argument ordinal, type, and projections. It exists only for
that immediate call judgment and has no source place support. A certificate
must not equate it with a later repetition of the source expression.

### Facts on and off

Acceptance-bearing entailment and certificate generation run identically in
facts-on and facts-off compilation. No optional optimizer fact may repair a
missing source proof. Explicit checks and claims remain retained. Call/S4 proof
does not become `llvm.assume` or an alternate lowering path.

### Provenance fixed points

O3's dependency and bridge summaries are observational today. A positive path
can explain membership, but absence in a seedless recursive component requires
the complete fixed point. Keep this analysis out of the verifier unless a
future approved gate makes it acceptance- or lowering-bearing.

## Failure behavior

For an internal certificate produced by the compiler:

- an invalid positive certificate is a compiler-internal failure;
- a missing certificate for an outcome the producer marked positive is a
  compiler-internal failure;
- neither condition becomes a source rejection;
- neither condition silently changes `discharged` to `unproved`;
- neither condition inserts an implicit source runtime check;
- no partially verified checked program is published.

If the complete producer simply misses a real derivation and reports
`unproved`, a small positive verifier cannot detect the false rejection. That
is a completeness defect in the canonical engine. It remains subject to exact
conformance tests, differential migration tests, and the specification's
determinism requirement. Calling the producer "untrusted" without this
qualification would be misleading: it may leave the safety-elision TCB after
Envelope B, but it remains conformance-critical.

## One lowering capability at Stage 3 and Stage 5

There should be exactly one unforgeable internal capability, a lifetime-bound
`EntailmentApprovedProgram<'unit>`, not a serialized proof. Stage 3's canonical
engine is its first issuer. If Envelope B later succeeds, Stage 5 replaces that
issuer with the trusted ProofFlow extractor, positive verifier, and atomic
publisher together; it does not introduce a second lowering interface.

Before the capability can be constructed, its issuer must establish complete
coverage of:

- every source bounds occurrence, with every accepted occurrence carrying its
  exact ENT-4 derivation;
- every ordinary call to a requirement-bearing callee, including concrete
  substitution, disposition, and the exact derivation for each discharge;
- every S4-bearing body's complete actual incoming-edge set, with each edge
  accounted for by a discharged ordinary call or a retained dynamic-entry
  evaluation;
- every required program-start or gated-entry wrapper/check record and retained
  entry-goal evaluation;
- every `for_stmt` and the complete derivation ledger for all of its S11 facts.

Each lowering-visible index or required call carries a private dense occurrence
ID tied to the same checked unit, and the sealed capability owns the complete
maps and ingress inventory. Lowering has no default branch for a missing
authorization. The backend need not understand the proof; it consumes IR that
could only have been built from the approved unit. Capability publication is
failure-atomic: no partial site map, body, or entry record can escape.

This local binding addresses the current global-authority problem without
inventing portable identities or making proof data a backend protocol.

## Diagnostics and determinism

The canonical engine continues to choose outcomes and first rejection in its
specified stable occurrence/rule order. Proof choice does not select a
diagnostic. Residual text is rendered from the normalized checked obligation,
never copied from a certificate.

Canonical parent selection is still desirable for stable testing and future
`proof_ref` diagnostics, but proof byte identity is not a language property.
The producer may not use randomness, a timeout, allocation identity, unordered
iteration, or worker scheduling to change an outcome. Verification failure is
an internal failure and does not cause the engine to try a different
source-language disposition.

## Performance evidence

These measurements use the active v0.26 compiler and specification bytes from
`441cd5b8`. The final refresh worktree rebuilt and reran the release probes after
activation; task 0048's later design-memory and coordination changes do not
change the measured binary. Results measure the whole compiler unless a sample
attribution is stated.

- 1.47 s real, 1.47 s user, 16.48 MB maximum RSS;
- five required redundant-claim advisories were emitted.

An independent repetition of the four-file unit observed 1.98 s and 1.47 s
release runs and approximately 16.9 MB maximum RSS. Debug runs were about
31.7 s, so architecture measurements must use release builds.

### Sampling profiles

The profile command shape was:

```text

`utf8parse.wf`, 2,393 samples:

- `entailment::state::close`: 99.29% inclusive, 33.31% self;
- SipHash `Hasher::write`: 36.98% self;
- `RandomState::hash_one` for a `(TermId, TermId)` pair: 29.08% self;
- the two observational `rewalk_unasserted` executions account for 66.44% of
  total samples on their call path.

The four-file deflate unit, 1,494 samples:

- `entailment::state::close`: 96.79% inclusive, 31.46% self;
- SipHash `Hasher::write`: 35.14% self;
- ordered-term-pair `hash_one`: 30.19% self;
- the two observational rewalks account for 67.01% of the `run` call path.

These profiles strongly identify repeated hash-based closure as the active
hot path. They do not measure certificate construction or verification, and
they do not prove that a particular replacement algorithm is faster.

### Cost implications

- A sparse used-premise witness can reuse closure predecessors and should not
  need a second closure. Its time and memory cost remain **not measured**.
- A positive verifier can be linear in the used proof and normalized-flow
  coverage it checks. Its actual cost remains **not measured**.
- A complete state certificate can approach `O(points * (terms^2 + goals))`
  memory before transition validation; it is disproportionate without contrary
  evidence.
- A query-local non-derivability certificate may use shortest-path dual
  potentials for one L0 state, but full flow completeness, opaque goals, joins,
  and loops remain unsolved. Its size and cost are **not measured**.
- Certificate architecture does not fix the producer hotspot. Closure algorithm
  work is a separate, measured performance project and should remain decoupled
  from the witness format.

## Alternatives under the same criteria

| Alternative | Architectural clarity | Soundness / correctness | Determinism and completeness | Compile/artifact cost | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unified engine as implemented | One result path, but normalization, flow, closure, diagnostics, and authority are tangled | Full TCB includes all discovery and lowering publication; current proof-to-site binding is implicit | One engine can implement exact negative outcomes | No certificate cost; current closure and rewalk cost is severe | Retain semantics, not structure |
| Unified engine plus complete derivation ledger | Satisfies DIAG-2 and makes positive derivations inspectable without another semantic path | Does not shrink TCB; catches no producer bug by itself | Exact behavior remains with the canonical engine | Likely small if parents are recorded in-line; must measure | Required conformance repair; measure before further split |
| Trusted ProofFlow plus positive verifier | Clean separation of normalization, completeness, validation, diagnostics, and lowering authority | Can remove closure/search from the safety TCB; extractor remains trusted | Engine still owns absence and exact accepted set | Avoids a second closure; proof and verifier cost unknown | Best future split candidate, conditional |
| Full proof-carrying checked IR / exact state verifier | Local authority is explicit | Sound only if complete state transitions and source coverage are checked | Can in principle certify exact outcomes, but recreates analyzer | Large state artifact and duplicate hot work | Reject now |
| Untrusted SMT producer | Search and validation can be separated in theory | SMT result alone is never authority; proof checker and exact encoding still required | Risks timeout/version-dependent false rejection and violates the current search-free architecture unless constrained to the exact calculus | External dependency and proof-format complexity with no measured need | Reject |
| Source/language proof objects | Makes writer evidence explicit | Could be sound with a language change | Changes accepted forms and author obligations | Large language, tooling, and review cost | Out of scope and reject for this problem |
| Missing-proof runtime fallback | Simple operational fallback | Safe only by retaining a check, but changes current source semantics and hides producer incompleteness | Changes accepted set, traps/effects, and diagnostics | Runtime and audit cost; repeats a rejected design | Reject |

### Status quo

The status quo wins on having one exact semantic path, but loses on reviewable
authority and current performance. Keeping it unchanged would leave both the
landed DIAG-2 derivation gap and the global implicit no-check boundary.

### Complete derivation ledger only

This is the smallest required conformance repair. It fulfills exact derivation
retention, improves explanations, and reveals whether certificates stay
compact. Beyond its mandatory retained-evidence role, it must be described as
observability, not independent verification.

### Producer plus verifier

This is selected only as Envelope B. "Untrusted producer" means the verifier
does not trust its positive safety conclusions; it does not mean the producer
may be incomplete while remaining conforming. Exact negative outcomes stay in
the canonical engine.

### Proof-carrying checked IR

The single local `EntailmentApprovedProgram` capability is a good downstream
gate once Stage-2 shadow inventory is complete; Envelope B may later replace
its issuer. A full state at every point is not a good certificate. Do not
conflate these two meanings of proof-carrying IR.

### SMT

The current fragment is closed, deterministic, and search-free. An SMT engine
would still need to emit a proof in the exact internal calculus, while adding
encoding, process, resource, and determinism boundaries. There is no current
expressiveness or performance evidence that requires it.

### Language proofs

Writer-authored proof objects would change the language and its review model.
The present problem is compiler-internal confidence in already normative
derivations. Exposing proofs cannot repair an internal authority boundary.

### Runtime fallback

The source language deliberately replaced implicit hidden checks with explicit
claims or rejection. Falling back when the producer or verifier fails would
make a compiler defect change traps, effects, diagnostics, and acceptance. It
is not an implementation-only choice.

## Adversarial review matrix

| Attack | Required response |
| --- | --- |
| Producer invents a term or goal ID | Verifier resolves only IDs owned by the same lifetime-bound `ProofFlow`; out-of-range or mismatched IDs fail internally |
| Proof is rebound to another subscript | Root includes exact function instance and occurrence; verified coverage maps one root to that occurrence only |
| Source fact appears before execution | Point phase and source-event class reject it |
| Claim cites its own result | Claim disposition point precedes S3 establishment |
| Set commit is ignored | Carry across the post-commit edge fails on overlapping support |
| Callee write or consume is ignored | ProofFlow derives kill edges from checked modes/effects and actual projections; verifier checks carry against them |
| Scope exit is applied after join | Canonical graph places exit kills on predecessor edges before the join |
| Join omits one path | Join proof enumerates the extractor-owned predecessor inventory exactly once |
| Contradictory predecessor blocks a valid join | Verified contradiction marks that predecessor neutral under the normative rule |
| False contradiction authorizes everything | Explosion requires a checked negative self-bound or opposite exact signs at the same live point |
| Derived fact survives a normal kill | Only live facts carry; query-only closure results require rederivation after the kill |
| Counted preheader consequence disappears or survives incorrectly | Dedicated snapshot step precedes continuing-kill subtraction; no other materialization is admitted |
| Ordinary loop acquires induction | Loop carry accepts only surviving pre-loop facts; no back-edge establishment rule exists |
| Recursive proof becomes circular | Acceptance roots are local per concrete call edge; certificate IDs must be acyclic/topologically earlier |
| Generic proof crosses instances | Every identity is under one concrete instance after substitution |
| Named constants collapse in opaque goals | Goal datum retains declaration identity; only checked L0 projection folds value |
| Ephemeral actual is reused later | Its identity is scoped to one call occurrence and has no source-origin rule |
| Facts-off skips validation | Acceptance and certificate pipeline are identical in both modes |
| Backend receives an uncovered no-check operation | Future lowering input is constructible only after complete verified-site coverage |
| Extractor forgets a subscript or kill | This remains a safety-TCB defect; exhaustive checked-node construction, mutation tests, and independent behavioral cases are required |
| Certificate arithmetic overflows | Kernel uses checked exact arithmetic under an explicit representational bound; overflow is an internal resource/invariant failure, never saturation-based evidence |
| Invalid proof changes source diagnostic | Verification failure is internal and publishes no semantic result |

## Migration plan

Every step below requires separate owner approval and an independently claimed
task.

### Stage 0: terminal refresh — completed

- Task 0048 became terminal at `b8824845`; the separate Stage 5b plan
  selection landed at `df55e7c`.
- This research branch was rebased exactly onto `df55e7c`.
- The active specification, outline, plan, terminal task record, acceptance
  evidence, relevant live design memory, checked model, entailment,
  provenance, lowering, backend, and tests were rechecked.
- The release probes and profiles were rerun on the landed active-v0.26
  compiler/specification bytes. Object comparison after the terminal refresh
  proves those measured bytes did not change, so no candidate-only result
  remains.

### Stage 1: complete DIAG-2 derivation ledger

- Keep the existing engine as the sole acceptance authority.
- Record canonical parents during existing closure and flow work.
- Retain exact roots and derivations for every accepted subscript, every
  discharged call goal, and every S11 fact of every `for_stmt`, whether or not a
  later query uses that fact.
- Optionally retain observational roots for every other positive/refuting
  outcome and contradiction used by a reported judgment.
- Do not alter lowering authority or runtime behavior.
- Measure witness nodes, bytes, peak memory, compile-time delta, and proof depth
  on protected programs.
- Mutation-test identities, invalidations, joins, contradiction, loop ordering,
  substitutions, and proof-root coverage.

If a landed case cannot be represented compactly and exactly, stop the split
and retain the unified engine with better internal factoring only.

### Stage 2: shadow the complete authorization inventory

- Enumerate every bounds occurrence and required ordinary call directly from
  the canonical checked semantic unit.
- Enumerate every S4-bearing body's complete actual incoming-edge set and every
  program-start or gated-entry wrapper/check and goal-evaluation record.
- Enumerate every `for_stmt` and cross-check its complete S11 derivation ledger.
- Compare those independently walked inventories with the entailment outcomes
  and derivation roots by exact occurrence identity.
- Publish no new authority and make no lowering or runtime change.

An omission, duplicate, stale identity, or unmatched ingress is an internal
failure. Do not proceed until the shadow inventories run without drift on the
protected corpus and real programs.

### Stage 3: canonical capability issuer

After Stage 2 is stable, make the canonical engine atomically issue the one
private `EntailmentApprovedProgram`. Construction requires the complete bounds,
call, S4-body ingress, dynamic-entry wrapper/check, entry-goal, and S11
inventories defined above. Lowering then has no default for an uncovered
operation or body ingress. This is an architectural binding gate, not
independent validation; it closes occurrence-omission, ingress-omission, and
proof-rebinding paths while leaving derivation soundness in the engine's TCB.

Do not extract `ProofFlow` merely to build this gate. Keeping this step small
tests the lowering boundary independently of the later producer/verifier
hypothesis.

### Stage 4: one canonical ProofFlow and shadow verifier

- Extract one structured, private proof-flow input from the checked semantic
  unit.
- Make program points, sources, kills, joins, loops, and queries explicit.
- Keep diagnostic text and policy outside it.
- Make both canonical engine and any shadow verifier consume the same input.
- Do not create a second source/AST semantic walk under a different name.

- Verify every positive path required by the complete DIAG-2 and lowering
  inventories, including all S11 facts, plus complete site and ingress coverage.
- Run after the canonical engine in shadow mode.
- Treat every failure as internal.
- Differentially compare the complete outcome bundle, diagnostics, and emitted
  behavior with the pre-migration path.
- Measure verification time and proof memory separately from producer time.

The extractor is accepted only if its trusted responsibility is
syntax-directed and reviewably smaller than the current flow analyzer. In
particular, the verifier must contain no parser, type checker, source goal
builder, full closure algorithm, or diagnostic selector.

### Stage 5: replace the capability issuer

Only if Stage 4 remains materially smaller, clear, exact on every landed case,
and acceptably cheap:

- make the trusted extractor, verifier, and atomic publisher jointly issue the
  existing lifetime-bound `EntailmentApprovedProgram`;
- require its complete local authorizations for bounds operations, required
  ordinary calls, S4 body ingress, dynamic-entry checks, and S11 evidence;
- retain the canonical engine for exact negative outcomes;
- retain dynamic entry checks and every explicit check/claim;
- remove transitional shadow-only paths once equivalence evidence is complete.

### Separate performance work

The current closure hotspot warrants its own measured task. Possible
directions include deterministic dense storage, sparse shortest-path queries,
incremental closure, and shared multi-lane computation for full/unasserted/
blinded states. This packet selects none of them without a benchmark. The
certificate format should describe semantic paths and not freeze the producer's
algorithm.

## Promotion and stop gates

Do not promote Envelope B unless all of the following are true:

- every landed positive obligation, call, claim, contradiction, join, ordinary
  loop, counted loop, generic, recursion, and identity case is expressible;
- source availability, support, kills, predecessor coverage, and loop carry are
  checked rather than trusted from the producer;
- verifier failure cannot become a source rejection or runtime fallback;
- no acceptance, claim outcome, residual, first diagnostic, runtime check,
  entry behavior, or facts-on/off behavior changes;
- the verifier contains no full closure and no duplicate source semantic walk;
- proof size, peak memory, producer overhead, and verifier time are measured on
  real programs;
- before implementation, the owner freezes explicit compile-time, peak-memory,
  and proof-size budgets, and the measured incremental cost stays within them;
- the new trusted extractor plus verifier is materially easier to audit than
  the current combined path;
- no serialization, cache, replay, solver, portable identity, or generalized
  theorem framework appears without a real approved consumer.

Stop and keep the unified engine if any gate fails. That is a successful
research result, not a reason to weaken the gate.

## Owner decisions

This research supports the following decisions:

1. How to authorize and sequence the mandatory bounded DIAG-2 conformance
   repair, including its complete bounds, call, and S11 derivation inventory.
2. Whether to include the additional observational used-premise witnesses and
   measurements in that task or keep them as a follow-up.
3. Whether to authorize the single local `EntailmentApprovedProgram` gate after
   complete shadow inventory, even if Envelope B is ultimately rejected;
   canonical issuance improves binding clarity but does not reduce the TCB.
4. What compile-time, peak-memory, and proof-size budgets to freeze before any
   Stage-4 verifier prototype.
5. Whether the measured closure/re-walk hotspot should precede certificate
   prototyping as the next compiler-performance experiment.

The recommendation is to repair the complete DIAG-2 derivation ledger first,
measure the shared parent arena, and make the one local lowering capability
conditional on complete shadow inventory. The measured closure/re-walk problem
should be addressed before any Stage-4 independent-verifier prototype, but it
need not block the mandatory derivation repair. The full producer/verifier split
remains deferred until those measurements and owner-frozen budgets exist.

## External research context

External work is analogy, not Whitefoot authority.

- Necula's original proof-carrying-code architecture separates an untrusted
  producer from a comparatively simple proof validator. That supports the
  positive-certificate direction, but Whitefoot additionally has normative
  negative outcomes that PCC-style positive validation does not settle:
  <https://doi.org/10.1145/263699.263712>.
- Oracle-based checking shows that a compact producer hint can guide a trusted
  checker and exposes proof-size/check-time tradeoffs. This supports measuring
  used premises before inventing a full proof object:
  <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/oracle_popl01.pdf>.
- Alethe illustrates the substantial proof-format and independent-checker work
  needed for general SMT proofs. Whitefoot has no current reason to import that
  machinery for a closed difference-bound fragment:
  <https://www.verit-solver.org/papers/pxtp2021.pdf>.
- CompCert TCB analysis is a useful warning that a proof kernel does not remove
  trust from language modeling, input translation, or unverified integration
  boundaries. Whitefoot must inventory `ProofFlow` extraction and lowering
  binding explicitly rather than counting only verifier lines:
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10280>.

  `<scratch-root>`.

Three independent read-only investigations covered the current TCB and metadata
flow, minimal certificate models, and adversarial determinism/completeness/cost.
All three converged on the same boundary: a sparse positive verifier can be
small, but an exact independent acceptance verifier currently becomes a second
analyzer.
