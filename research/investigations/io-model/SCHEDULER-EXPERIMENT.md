# Scheduler locality experiment

Question: does the choice of worker that resumes a parked stack materially
affect the network gap, without changing the source model or stack representation?
This experiment starts from the runtime merged as `2e84ff44`. It is an
experiment, not a selected replacement runtime. Results are pending.

The existing `RESULTS.md` third network series tested per-worker rings while
retaining the global ready queue. It did not test a complete per-worker
execution design. This first experiment separates queue locality from lock
sharding and ring ownership; those remain later independent variables.

## Forms

The same compiler emits each program once. The runtime is linked three times:

| policy | ready queues | destination | when local queue is empty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | one global FIFO | queue 0 | no other ready queue |
| 1 | one FIFO per worker | worker that parked the stack | scan all other queues |
| 2 | one FIFO per worker | worker that enqueues the stack | scan all other queues |

All forms keep the existing shared mutex, shared wake epoch, shared Linux
ring, progress policy, lane deques, stack count and stack representation.
An empty-to-nonempty transition of the union of ready queues wakes through the
shared epoch. A count under the same mutex preserves the original wake policy
in all three forms; the enumerator checks it against actual list membership.
Every pop checks all queues under the mutex before concluding no ready
work exists. A ready stack remains globally available: this is a preference,
not pinning. Policy 2 includes the worker committing an early notification;
adapter helpers have no worker identity and use queue 0. It is not a promise
that one worker receives every completion of a connection.

The stack records its parking worker before publishing SUSPENDING. The
existing handshake publishes that field to the enqueue, and the queue mutex
publishes it to the pop. The field is never changed while the stack is parked.
The record claim, DONE-last discipline, stack phases and memory orders stay
the same. The enumerator snapshots the queue arrays in the core and the
parking field in the stack header. Its invariants now check every queue's
tail, disjoint membership, valid destination and the union of ready queues
when checking that all workers cannot sleep beside ready work.

## Validation and measurement

`make scheduler-experiment` is part of root `make check`. It runs all existing
schedules at (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4) for every policy. The original compiler
gate also checks the default policy. The new gate matrix stage runs this on
Linux and macOS; production default changes also reach the existing native
Windows checks. This does not qualify the experimental policies on Windows.

`make -C research/experiments/io-completion-bench scheduler-bench` runs on
Linux. `.github/workflows/io-scheduler.yml` runs it on one hosted runner:

- One compiler revision, one host, explicit equal network worker counts,
  two warm-up passes, seven measured passes with reversed alternate order.
- Echo: 1, 4, 64, 1024 connections at 64 bytes, and 64 connections at 64 KiB.
  The existing io_uring and epoll references run in the same cohort.
- Every network sample verifies every echoed byte and both process exits;
  unexpected output or diagnostics fail the measurement.
- Throughput, p50/p99 latency, server CPU per round trip, peak resident memory
  and OS context switches are retained per sample. Ratios use the global FIFO
  in the same pass, connection count and payload; ranges accompany medians.
- Separate untimed observed links report parks, resumes, cross-worker resumes
  and ring counters. Instrumentation is absent from the timed binaries.
- Existing `par_layout` and `windows_runtime_mixed` run at 2, 4, 8 workers,
  with their existing expected output bytes and the paired C timing harness.
  The latter uses warm positioned reads. It measures compute/I/O coexistence,
  not network tail latency under long CPU work; that workload is still needed
  before selecting an overall mixed-load design.

CI duration limits fail an incomplete experiment. They never decide compiler
acceptance or turn an incomplete sample into a performance result. Host
metadata, raw samples, diagnostics and observed counters are artifacts; copy
the decision-relevant results and run URL into this document before those
artifacts expire. A client-limited plateau cannot establish executor parity.

## Interpretation and removal

A gain accompanied by fewer cross-worker resumes supports locality as one
cost. A flat result does not reject per-worker execution: the shared mutex,
shared ring and eager stealing remain. Neither result decides stackful versus
stackless representation or whether source signatures need to change.

The temporary selectors, runner, gate stage and workflow belong to this
investigation. Once the locality question is settled, record the reasoning
in `mcts_mem/`, retain measured evidence here, and remove the unused forms or
replace them in place with the next controlled comparison. They must not grow
into a permanent collection of runtime switches.
