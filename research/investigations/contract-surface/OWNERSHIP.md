# Ownership transfer and reference-access forms

This investigation compares the remaining ownership surface after signature
`own` was removed. Its baseline is specification v0.69 and repository revision
`0f22b026b`. The concrete consumers are the maintained HashMap and Deque
libraries and the owned-link cursor program. The active specification remains
the language authority; candidate spellings below are not accepted syntax.

## Requirements and comparison criterion

Record these criteria before trying the alternatives:

- Preserve copy/drop capabilities, exactly-once consumption of noncopy owners,
  whole-owner partial moves, linear-value obligations and derived cleanup.
- Preserve reference-holder identity, rebinding, captured selectors,
  invalidation, overlap and declared effects. A shorter access must select the
  same path and establish the same partial-operation obligations.
- Determine a written use from its syntax, the already known local kinds and
  generic bounds. Do not select copying, moving or borrowing from later uses,
  from the selected concrete generic instance, or from a preferred overload.
- Compare the same operation and result contract, including error and
  replacement outcomes. Do not label an API obsolete merely because it
  consumes an input and produces an output.
- Distinguish lexical shortening from fewer ownership transfers or runtime
  operations. Source counts in these examples do not establish population
  frequency, writer productivity or performance improvement.

The alternatives are discriminated by paired normal/error examples and by
counterexamples: copy and noncopy generic instances, owner use after transfer,
stored linear fields, reference aliases versus referent reads, holder rebinding
versus referent assignment, ancestor replacement, and effect overlap.
An alternative that only shifts the same obligation into another mandatory
declaration has not removed that obligation.

## Questions

1. Do current container interfaces still require avoidable owner-in/owner-out
   mutation? Compare ordinary writes through a reference with a consuming
   rebuild, release and atomic owned transformation.
2. Should ordinary affine expressions, match scrutinees, propagation and
   destructuring share one consumption spelling? Compare the current rules,
   explicit markers at every consuming boundary, and type-directed consumption
   of bare value places. Keep last-use inference a separate alternative.
3. Can reference projections become shorter without implicit value reads or
   confusing holder assignment with referent assignment? Compare the current
   `deref` step, an explicit projection spelling, and automatic reference
   projection. Whole-referent access and forwarding a reference must remain
   distinct observations.

## Current rule boundary

OWN-1 requires `move` for ordinary affine place expressions and rejects it on
copy values. FN-2 checks that spelling against a generic body's bounds once;
an unbounded generic `move` may denote copying at a copy instance. OWN-13 and
ERR-3 independently supply consuming contexts for an own-place match and a
bare affine Result propagation operand. Thus written `move` is neither every
ownership transfer nor an unconditional promise of noncopy behavior.

REF-1 makes a bare reference binding an alias or a forwarded reference.
TYPE-7 requires `deref` to reach its referent. SET-1 distinguishes rebinding a
reference holder from storing through it. `Box.inner` is a separate ordinary
owned-field step. Removing a repeated `deref` spelling must not erase those
distinctions.

## Consumer comparison

| Consumer | Actual ownership boundary | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| [HashMap](../../../lib/containers/hash-map.wf) | `try_put`, `put`, `remove`, `reserve`, `rehash` and `rebuild` take a reference to the map. Offered keys/values arrive by value; replacement or refusal returns a complete pair. | Ordinary mutation already avoids returning the map. Returning displaced or refused elements preserves ownership, including linear elements; dropping those results would change the contract. |
| [Deque](../../../lib/containers/deque.wf) | Push/pop mutate through references. `rebase` consumes the old backing and returns a new one; `free_empty` consumes an empty backing. | Rebase deserves a same-contract reference comparison. Freeing and removing an element are genuine consuming operations. |
| [Owned-link cursor](../../../tests/programs/owned_link_cursors.wf) | `without_first` consumes a link and returns its successor; `remove_even` uses it in `set deref(cursor) = without_first(head: move deref(cursor));`. | The owned transformer supplies OP-12's indivisible replacement. Deleting its ownership boundary would require another complete implementation, not just a shorter signature. |

HashMap rebuild is also a counterexample to the claim that a new allocation
necessarily requires an owned interface: it swaps backing through a reference.
Its current contract does not publish the extent relations that Deque rebase
does, however. Those are different proof contracts.

### Deque reference-rebuild probes

The direct wrapper below is a checked research fragment, not a proposed
library addition. Compile it with the existing Deque source and a main:

```wf
fn deque_rebase_reference<T, const ceiling: u64>(values: &Box<Ring<T>>, capacity: u64) -> result: unit writes(values) contract {
  requires capacity >= deref(values).inner.len;
  requires capacity <= ceiling;
  ensures deref(values).inner.len == deref(entry(values)).inner.len;
  ensures deref(values).inner.cap == capacity;
  ensures deref(values).inner.head == 0_u64;
} {
  set deref(values) = deque_rebase::<T, ceiling>(values: move deref(values), capacity: capacity);
  return unit;
}
```

| Probe | Observed result at the baseline revision | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Existing Deque program and existing owned-link cursor | Both compile and return native exit 0. | Controls exercise the current APIs and cursor replacement. |
| Unbounded wrapper above | WIN-3 at the `set` target: linear assignment target. | OP-12 covers copy/affine targets; WIN-3 rejects a linear target. A `drop` bound would exclude supported `nodrop` elements. |
| Same wrapper with `T: drop` | FN-9 at `return unit`: unproved length postcondition. | Passing the ownership check is not sufficient to publish the original contract. The precise classification of this measured-result establishment limit remains open. |
| `T: drop` wrapper with all three `ensures` clauses removed | Compiles to LLVM. | A mechanism control only: weakening the contract is not a successful equivalent replacement. |
| Transfer elements through the reference, then swap in the completed backing and free the old empty backing | OP-14 at the empty-input branch's `free_empty`: the old backing's zero length is unavailable after swap. | PRE-1 gives swap no postcondition and MSR-3 does not transport measures through swap. This is the already recorded descriptor-fact limitation, now affecting linear cleanup. |

The last probe is reproduced from the existing `deque_rebase` body: change
the signature and contract to the wrapper's; replace body `values.inner`
with `deref(values).inner`; remove the explanatory `doc`; replace both
`free_empty(window: move values); return move built;` sequences with
`swap(first: values, second: &built); free_empty(window: move built); return unit;`.
Keep the loop, invariants and allocation unchanged. The compiler rejects the
first cleanup before testing the later postconditions; this does not establish
that every remaining obligation would pass after measure transport was added.

The intended caller comparison uses all seven rebase sites in the maintained
[Deque program](../../../tests/programs/containers/deque-program.wf), covering
scalar, boxed, `nodrop` and unit elements. Replace each
`let next = deque_rebase::<...>(values: move old, capacity: cap);` with a call
to the reference helper on `&old`, followed by `let next = move old;` solely
to preserve the existing oracle's names. The unbounded wrapper and swap
implementation fail before that native comparison can run. No runtime or
transfer-cost equivalence is claimed for them.

Recommendation: retain the existing library interfaces in this investigation.
Reopen replacement and measure transport with this exact contract, rather than
introducing a weaker overload or describing `nodrop` exclusion as cleanup.
Extending OP-12 to linear targets is a separate language opportunity: the
callee could consume the old owner and return a replacement without implicit
drop. It needs its own account of failure exits, joins, aliases and effects;
the current prohibition alone proves neither that extension necessary nor
unsound. The swap route also merits comparison once its evidence can cross
the exchange. These related tasks remain grouped in
[the maintained TODO](../../../docs/todo.md).

## Consumption spelling

The current surface gives equivalent consuming forms to a noncopy own-place
match and affine propagation, while ordinary assignments, operands and returns
require `move`:

```text
Current:  consume(value: move owner);  return move owner;
Current:  match outcome { ... }       match move outcome { ... }
Current:  let value = propagate outcome;
Current:  let value = propagate move outcome;
```

OWN-1 supplies the ordinary requirement; OWN-13 and ERR-3 supply the implicit
contexts. FN-2's symbolic-body judgment adds a different qualification:
`return move value;` in `fn pass<T: drop>(value: T) -> back: T` may copy at
a copy instance. The marker is not an unconditional runtime move instruction.

| Alternative | Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Current mixed contexts | Fewer markers in match and propagate. | The writer needs context-specific consumption rules; explicit and implicit forms coexist there. |
| Explicit consuming owned places everywhere | One requirement for existing noncopy owners across calls, construction, binding, return, match and propagate. | Adds markers at currently implicit sites; symbolic generic checking still determines copy capability. |
| Bare places copy or consume according to their known kind and bound | Removes `move` and its exceptions without requiring last-use inference. | An ordinary-looking field projection can consume its entire owner and release other fields, even when no later use exposes the change. |
| Infer borrowing or transfer from later uses | May shorten more source. | Later edits can change an earlier boundary; it does not meet the recorded local-decision criterion. |

Type-directed implicit consumption is technically viable in principle, not a
harder proof search. [Rust's place-to-value rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions)
provide a concrete comparator: copyability and the place determine copying or
moving without a last-use rule. Whitefoot's whole-owner consumption is an
additional consideration. In its owned-link helper,

```text
let node = move cell.inner;
return move node.next;
```

the first line consumes the Box and releases its cell; the second consumes
the entire node, not just the selected field. In an aggregate with other
affine fields, those fields are released. Without the marker,
`let selected = owner.field;` can look like ordinary field access while
discarding the rest of `owner`. The liveness checker still prevents later
reuse and linear residuals still reject, so this is a source-intent tradeoff,
not a claim that implicit moves would break memory safety.

The recommended proposal is **explicit consuming uses of existing noncopy
owned places**, including `match move outcome` and `propagate move outcome`.
It preserves the event marker while removing the two implicit-context rules.
Copy places remain bare; non-place temporary results need no marker; a match
through a reference remains non-consuming. Generic spelling remains checked
once against the written bound. Destructuring retains its existing consuming
form and capability restrictions. There is no new last-use inference, clone,
automatic borrow, or change to whole-owner cleanup.

This requires retiring bare affine match and propagation acceptance, not merely
encouraging a style. The affected rules are OWN-1, OWN-13 and ERR-3, with
FN-2's generic qualification retained; conformance and examples would migrate
with the implementation. The proposed tree addition is in
[the consumption amendment](../../../design/amendments/consumption-spelling.md).
It adds one decision and one refused alternative to `language/ownership`;
existing decisions remain. The new decision replaces the implicit-context
choice in OWN-13 and ERR-3 that the tree's existing explicit-move decision
does not separately describe. It is awaiting a ruling and is not implemented
in this research PR.

## Reference-place spelling

The path model and its current syntax have different histories. The early
[x1 spelling map](../access-effects/SPEC-AMENDMENT-MAP.md#surface-and-spelling)
suggested direct reference access and using `deref` for Box content. That was
design pseudocode. The later
[Box field ruling](https://github.com/mbbill/Whitefoot/commit/c302bcc7f3c0ec66c6167b2859c2fc63c42be872)
records the accepted separation: `.inner` reaches owned Box content and
`deref` reaches a reference's referent. The current REF-1 and TYPE-7, not the
early examples, govern source programs.

Three viable alternatives preserve the reference/owner distinction:

| Form | Example | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Current explicit prefix step | `&deref(node).inner.next` | Explicit for both a whole referent and a projection, but wraps the existing path. |
| Explicit postfix step | `&node.*.inner.next` | Keeps the explicit distinction and extends paths in reading order. Changes a spelling, not an access permission. |
| Automatic projection through a known reference | `&node.inner.next` | Shorter still; only the known local kind is needed. Whole-referent access still needs a separate spelling, and a rule must fix when an explicit referent step is admitted before a projection. |

Automatic projection need not imply general inference or overloaded
dereferencing. A Whitefoot candidate could insert exactly one reference step
before a field, payload, index, range or measure selection, never through a
Box. [Rust's automatic field dereferencing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/field-expr.html#automatic-dereferencing)
is broader: it follows `Deref`/`DerefMut` repeatedly. That trait mechanism is
not proposed here. Separately, an implicit whole-referent read selected by an
expected type would give bare `p` a referent-read meaning at value arguments
while `let q = p;` still needs an alias default. That is a further contextual
conversion, not an unavoidable ambiguity or a necessary part of shorter paths.

The recommended proposal is the explicit postfix step `.*`, replacing
`deref(place)` throughout ordinary and proof places:

```text
Current                                  Proposed
let alias = cursor;                      let alias = cursor;
match deref(cursor) { ... }              match cursor.* { ... }
let value = deref(node).inner.value;      let value = node.*.inner.value;
set cursor = &deref(node).inner.next;     set cursor = &node.*.inner.next;
set deref(cursor) = f(head: move deref(cursor));
set cursor.* = f(head: move cursor.*);
deref(entry(values)).inner.len           entry(values).*.inner.len
```

The new grammar candidate replaces only these productions:

```text
pbase   := IDENT | "entry" "(" IDENT ")"
psuffix := "." IDENT | "." TYPEID "." IDENT | "[" atom range_tail? "]" | "." "*"
```

The step is admitted only on a reference kind; `Box.inner` is unchanged.
Bare references still forward or alias, `set cursor = ...` still rebinds,
`set cursor.* = ...` still writes the referent, and `&cursor` remains invalid.
Index capture, payload refinements, range bounds, no moving through references
outside admitted operations, and invalidation follow the same resolved path.
Effect rows keep their existing parameter-rooted grammar (`writes(values.inner)`);
this proposal does not add `.*` to effect selectors. There is no overload or
recursive automatic traversal. Retire the `deref` terminal; its bytes become
an ordinary IDENT under FORM-3. The old prefix access is not retained as an alias.

This is a lexical and path-composition improvement. It does not remove the
semantic distinction the explicit step carries, transfer fewer owners, or
establish a productivity or compile-time gain. The strong-LL(2) experiment
below removes parsing ambiguity as an objection; it does not select the form
by implementation convenience. Its selection ground is one explicit step
usable identically for a projection and the whole referent, without wrapping
the preceding path or making that step optional at selected sites.
The complete tree revision is in
[the reference-place amendment](../../../design/amendments/reference-place-spelling.md).
Its first decision replaces the first decision of
`language/ownership/reference-validity`, changing only the reference-step
spelling; its second adds the spelling's selection ground. The node's remaining
decisions and refused alternatives are unchanged. It is awaiting a ruling and
is not implemented in this research PR.

## Validation and remaining uncertainty

The criteria above were published in commit `3ece3c54c` before the probes.
All source observations use the unmodified v0.69 compiler built from baseline
`0f22b026b` with `make -C compiler build` (gate profile, locked and offline).
Native controls use the default ordinary compiler path, without compute mode.
The build took about 49 seconds on this host; that is construction evidence,
not a timing comparison between language alternatives.

For baseline reproduction from the repository root:

```sh
make -C compiler build
probe_dir=$(mktemp -d)
perl .github/run-check.pl deque-control compiler/target/gate/whitefootc lib/containers/deque.wf tests/programs/containers/deque-program.wf -o "$probe_dir/deque"
"$probe_dir/deque"
perl .github/run-check.pl cursor-control compiler/target/gate/whitefootc tests/programs/owned_link_cursors.wf -o "$probe_dir/cursor"
"$probe_dir/cursor"
```

For source-only probes, use `whitefootc --emit-llvm SOURCE... -o output.ll`
under the same guard. Supply the wrapper and Deque sources plus this main:

```wf
fn main() -> status: ExitStatus pure {
  return exit_status(code: 0_u8);
}
```

The normal/error propagation pair used this helper, once with the bare operand
and once with `propagate move incoming`:

```wf
fn forward(incoming: Result<Box<u64>, unit>) -> result: Result<Box<u64>, unit> pure {
  let value = propagate incoming;
  return Ok<Box<u64>, unit>(value: move value);
}
```

Both versions compiled and their native drivers returned 0: `Ok` preserved
a boxed 7 and `Err(unit)` stayed an error. Inserting `let reused = move incoming;`
after propagation rejected with OWN-1 use-after-move. Additional controls:

| Source or transformation | Observation |
|---|---|
| `tests/conformance/cases/own1-neg-move-of-copy.wf` | OWN-1, move of copy. |
| `tests/conformance/cases/fn2-pos-the-template-is-the-spelling-authority.wf` | Compiles to LLVM; the symbolic body retains `move` at copy instances. |
| `tests/conformance/cases/xfail-own1-bare-affine-use.wf` | OWN-1, bare affine use. The historical filename is not a verdict change. |
| `tests/conformance/cases/type7-neg-propagate-reference-holder.wf` | OWN-1, move through reference at `propagate deref(holder)`. |
| Owned-link source with `match deref(cursor)` replaced by `match cursor` | TYPE-7, missing dereference. |
| Owned-link source with `deref(node).inner` replaced by `node.inner` | TYPE-7, missing dereference. |

For the grammar experiment, a scratch Rust driver imports the unchanged
`compiler/src/syntax/grammar/generator.rs`. Run its public
`generate(path, specification)` on the baseline text, then on a copy replacing
exactly `pbase` and `psuffix` with the candidate productions above. Both
complete without a prediction conflict. Compile the driver with
`rustc --edition=2024` under the ordinary command guard. This uses the native
generator, not another parser or a revised language implementation.

Neither candidate has a lexer/parser/checker/formatter implementation yet.
Adoption must check old-form refusal and new-form acceptance, copy and generic
controls, whole-owner partial consumption, linear residuals, borrowed matches,
entry projections, effect overlap and reference invalidation. The source
boundary and Deque failures above are concrete evidence; error-rate improvement,
generated-writer performance, equal machine code and compile-time change remain
unmeasured. Full `make check` was not run for this research-only change.
